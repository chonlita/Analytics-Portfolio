{"Australian federal budget 2024: what we know so far and what to expect [2024-05-10T03:05:56Z]": "On 14 May the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will deliver his second full-year budget. \nChalmers has promised more cost-of-living relief in a budget that he says tackles inflation but sets Australia\u2019s economy up for growth \u2013 neither scorched-earth nor a free-for-all of spending. \n Here\u2019s what we know already about what is in the budget. \nTax cuts and cost of living \nThe biggest element of the cost-of-living relief in the budget is the changes to stage-three tax cuts, a $359bn 10-year tax cut package announced by Labor in January and legislated in February with opposition support. \nThe package means all Australian taxpayers (earning over the tax-free threshold of $18,200) get a tax cut, doubling the benefit for an average income earner compared with the Coalition\u2019s original stage three proposal. \n  \n  \n   default\n  \n  \n \nLabor says 84% of taxpayers are better off under its proposal, although those earning more than $146,486 would have received more under the Coalition\u2019s model. \nThere will be other cost-of-living measures the government claims won\u2019t add to inflation, which might point towards extending energy price relief. \nJim Chalmers has poured cold water on the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee\u2019s call for jobseeker to rise to 90% of the age pension, although he and the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, have seemed more open on increasing rent assistance. Chalmers has confirmed there will be \u201cadditional steps\u201d on poverty reduction and \u201cnew initiatives for housing\u201d. \nEducation, skills and Hecs \nThe government will wipe $3bn from student debts by indexing Hecs and Help debts to the lower of the consumer price index or the wage price index, backdated to June 2023. \nThe government will also pay student teachers, nurses, midwives and social workers $320 a week during their mandatory work placements, starting from July 2025. These two measures are aspects of the government\u2019s response to the Universities Accord, but there will be more in the budget. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nThe government has announced $90.6m to boost the number of skilled workers in the construction and housing sector, creating 15,000 fee-free Tafe places and 5,000 places for pre-apprenticeships. \nSchool funding will also rise as the federal government negotiates with the states to cover the 5% funding gap, most recently offering to lift its share of funding from 20% to 22.5%. This is estimated to cost $6bn over five years, although Chalmers has been coy about whether estimates will be reflected in the budget or only be added after education and health agreements are finalised. \nChildcare \nThere is no question childcare workers will be receiving a pay rise in this budget \u2013 the only questions are how much and how it will be distributed. With the industry in crisis due to staffing shortages, which have been exacerbated by staff leaving to work in aged care after that sector\u2019s pay rise win, the government is expected to make wage increases for childcare workers a centre piece of the budget. \nBut it\u2019s unclear whether the government will pull the trigger on scrapping the activity test, which sets a subsidy rate based on employment. It has indicated it wants to get rid of the measure as part of its plan to make childcare in Australia \u201cuniversal\u201d, though it\u2019s not clear whether it will happen in this budget. \nHealth and aged care \nPublic hospitals are expected to get more funding, as the federal government works to finalise a new five-year agreement with the states to start in mid-2025. The commonwealth has reportedly offered to lift funding by an extra $4bn in 2025-26 and $13bn over the whole five years. \nThe government is also increasing funding for its medical research future fund over 13 years, with $1.1bn for existing projects plus $150m million to investigate rarely survived cancers, and $150m towards reducing inequalities in the health system. A further $500m will go to other research schemes. \nThe government is also yet to outline its response to March\u2019s aged care taskforce report, which suggested new ways to pay for the system \u2013 including asking Australians with more wealth to pay more for the cost of their care. \nThe health minister, Mark Butler, also announced $49.1m would go toward offering longer consultations of 45 minutes or longer for endometriosis sufferers. \nAmong a total of $15.4bn in \u201cunavoidable spending\u201d to continue programs from the previous government is money set aside for palliative care, cancer supports, public health chronic conditions, and alcohol and other drug treatments. \nDefence and foreign affairs \nThe budget will confirm that Australia\u2019s defence spending will increase from 2.1% of Australia\u2019s economic output next financial year to 2.4% by 2033-34, driven by a range of big-spending projects including the Aukus nuclear-powered submarines. \nThere will be some cuts to programs, however, with the government announcing last month that it would free up about $73bn over 10 years by cutting, delaying or changing the scope of some defence projects. \nEven after these cuts are taken into account, the government says it has committed a net increase of $50.3bn for defence over the next 10 years. This includes a net increase of $5.7bn over the immediate four-year budget cycle. \nThis immediate funding includes $1bn over the next four years for long-range strike, targeting and autonomous systems. \nIn foreign affairs, the government has promised $492m for the Asian Development Fund\u2019s 2025-28 pledging round, to \u201chelp respond to the needs of the region and deliver transformative development projects across the Indo-Pacific\u201d. \nInfrastructure \nSo far, western Sydney is the biggest winner in infrastructure after the minister, Catherine King, announced $1.9bn in funding for 14 road and transport projects. Those include road upgrades, planning projects and extra money for a business case to extend the train line into the city\u2019s south-west. \nCyclists will also get a boost with $100m being set aside to build and upgrade bicycle and walking lines in cities and regional centres. \nCanberra will also get a $50m injection to extend its light rail line from the northern suburbs past Parliament House and into the city\u2019s south.  \nThe nation\u2019s capital are getting a good deal because $249.7m has also been announced for Australian Institute of Sport as the 2032 Brisbane Olympics inches closer. \nThe quarter of a billion-dollar sum will go towards refreshing the ageing site with new accommodation, an all-weather sports dome and a new training centre. \nBeyond Canberra, road safety data from the states and territories will also be better harmonised with a $21m funding announcement to set up a national data hub.  \nFuture Made in Australia \nThe government has announced funding for a range of projects under its Future Made in Australia policy, which aims to directly support Australian industry and innovation, particularly in green energy. These commitments include: \n \n $1bn for the Solar Sunshot production of solar panels in the Hunter \n $1bn to PsiQuantum to build the world\u2019s first fault tolerant quantum computer in Brisbane \n $840m for Arafura\u2019s rare earth metals production in the Northern Territory \n An export agreement to sell armoured vehicles made by the German defence manufacturer Rheinmetall \n $566m over 10 years for GeoScience Australia to map what is under Australia\u2019s soil and seabed \n $400m in new loans to Alpha HPA for Australia\u2019s first high-purity alumina processing facility in Queensland; and \n $185m to Renascor Resources to fast-track the development of stage one of its Siviour Graphite Project in South Australia; and \n $100m to speed up environmental approvals, including assistance for business. \n \nGender equality \nThe government has committed $925m for the leaving violence payment, a payment of $5,000 to help meet the costs of leaving a relationship. The existing trial will be extended and the new permanent program available from mid-2025. \nThe government has also said that parents will receive 12% superannuation \u2013 or about $106 a week \u2013 on their publicly funded paid parental leave from July 2025, full costings for which will be in the budget. \nIndigenous affairs \nThe government has not foreshadowed any new major spending commitments in the Indigenous affairs space, but the budget will contain details and funding for several large programs in that portfolio that were recently unveiled. \nThe Closing The Gap commitments from February, including a $700m remote jobs program, and March\u2019s announcement of a $4bn remote housing program for the Northern Territory, are expected to be the major components of the Indigenous affairs portfolio. Most of the new commitments in Indigenous affairs are typically contained in February\u2019s Closing The Gap document rather than the May budget. \nAttorney General\u2019s Department \nThe government has pledged $161.3m to establish the national firearms register, and $11m for an app alerting Australians in real time if somebody tries to use their data to commit fraud. \nThe government will invest $166.4m to implement reforms to Australia\u2019s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regime.", "From rural medicine to tech innovations: two trailblazers channel their studies into what matters  [2023-11-20T03:21:35Z]": "Named in the Forbes 30 Under 30 list for Asia last year, Mikaela Seymour has achieved much since graduating from Griffith University. Seymour studied for a Bachelor of Medical Science at the Queensland-based university, and then a four-year postgraduate Doctor of Medicine (MD), which she completed in 2015. While there, she decided the most rewarding path would be to pursue rural and remote medicine. \u201cI completed a rotation in tropical medicine organised by the School of Medicine and Dentistry in partnership with Rural Medical Education Australia [RMEA],\u201d she says.     Mikaela Seymour  Then, in 2020, she was embedded with the newly established Sustainable Development Program aerial health patrols based in Balimo, in Western Province, Papua New Guinea. \u201cThis is an area that had been wholly neglected, without a doctor for 20 years,\u201d Seymour says. She recalls focusing on preventative healthcare rather than reactive \u2013 prioritising what would have the biggest impact on the community in the long term \u2013 despite the challenges presented by the remoteness of some of the region.    This is an area that had been wholly neglected, without a doctor for 20 years.  Mikaela Seymour     \u201cThere was no phone connection, no electricity, no running water \u2013 we had to collect our water from the river and boil it. That made infection prevention and control [difficult]. So [we were] using a lot of innovation to try and get the best outcomes for patients, with very limited resources.\u201d Making an impact through medicine Since that first visit Seymour has returned to work in Papua New Guinea every year. \u201cI have served on hospital ships sailing to some of the remotest islands of Milne Bay, and volunteered back at Kiunga Hospital to support Griffith\u2019s rural medical and midwifery students program,\u201d she says. \u201cMore recently, I joined Australian Doctors International as the doctor on the ground for a new program serving Middle Fly, an area of PNG that has been neglected for too long. I had the absolute privilege to fly on small Caravan eight-seater planes, landing on grass air strips, and be hosted by communities.\u201d Seymour says Griffith\u2019s rural program, in partnership with RMEA, made her adaptable. \u201cI am now completing my advanced training in public health medicine and spent a year studying at the PNG Institute of Medical Research in Goroka,\u201d she says. \u201cDuring my time there I was able to work with the WHO office in the quantification of the effect of Covid-19 on health systems, work for the chief public health officer of Eastern Highlands, and be supervised by Dr [Pamela] Toliman, one of the lead scientists in the validation of Covid-19 rapid diagnostic tests in the Pacific.\u201d \u201c[Griffith\u2019s] emphasis on multidisciplinary and cross-cultural training made it easy for me to assimilate into these diverse teams.\u201d Tech innovations for good Raymond Siems studied a Bachelor of Engineering at Griffith and has founded multiple innovative tech businesses that have had a positive impact. \u201cWhen we start a new company we look for something that is good for people or society and also good business,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is influenced by the systems thinking I was taught at uni \u2013 an approach to problem solving that takes into account the overall system and connections between elements, rather than each part in isolation.\u201d    While at university, Siems met the co-founders of his first enterprise, Ventoura, a team with which he still works with nearly 10 years on. \u201cWe were passionate about travel and wanted to create a platform for peer-to-peer experiences so that travellers could get off the beaten track and see the locals\u2019 side of their destination,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were lucky enough to start working with investors from Helsinki. We were young and jumped at the opportunity to move. A few weeks later we were in Finland.\u201d    Often there\u2019s no secret sauce; the answer is just getting started and persevering.  Raymond Siems     In 2016, a scholarship took Siems to the University of Cambridge. In the UK he has founded startups including Catalyst AI, which uses data science and machine learning to help fashion companies reduce waste by optimising supply chains, and created a crowdfunding platform to support National Health Service workers. \u201cDuring the pandemic our team helped to build a fundraising and distribution platform that was able to transform gifts in kind and donations from the public into support for about 100,000 healthcare workers,\u201d he says. His latest business, Ravio, aims to bring data-driven decision-making to team management, to enable companies to pay people fairly and build more diverse teams. \u201cWhat you get paid at work is opaque and filled with bias. And yet it [has] such a big influence on our lives. It determines the lives we can lead and many of the opportunities we have. \u201cWe help companies improve their compensation practices, analysing their gender pay gap, and evaluating whether they are paying their employees fairly and competitively with the market with our benchmarking platform.\u201d Siems says starting out at Griffith gave him the drive to keep innovating and founding new projects. \u201cThe technical skills I learned through my degree gave me foundational skills I was able to rapidly build on once I started my career,\u201d he says. \u201cLearning the theory and quickly turning it into practice. This helped in turning a business idea into something real without hesitation. \u201cOften there\u2019s no secret sauce; the answer is just getting started and persevering.\u201d            Find out what you can study at Griffith University.", "Morning Mail: PM reveals green industry strategy; Biden \u2018considering\u2019 dropping Assange charges; Queensland conspiracy theories [2024-04-10T20:51:13Z]": "Good morning.

This year\u2019s budget centres on health, housing and youth crime, with another $89bn slated for infrastructure projects over the next four years. Here is a breakdown of the winners and losers in Queensland\u2019s 2023 state budget:  Winners Parents The Queensland government has announced it will fund up to 15 hours of free kindergarten for all four-year-olds across the state each week. The $645m measure will save Queenslanders up to $4,600 a year in kindergarten fees. The government will also provide up to $150 for swimming lessons for eligible children aged 0 to four years old, and $2.7m over the next two years to expand school breakfast programs in areas experiencing financial hardship.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Households All Queensland households will receive a $550 electricity rebate this year, with concession holders to receive an additional $150 energy payment. Vulnerable Queenslanders will continue to receive the existing $372 rebate, bringing total support for this group to $1,072 in 2023-4. The treasurer, Cameron Dick, said the rebate was the most generous of all the states and territories and meant many Queenslanders won\u2019t pay for electricity at all next year. Regional Queenslanders Regional Queenslanders will benefit from an additional $70.3m over four years in the budget for the patient travel subsidy scheme. The program provides financial support to patients who need to travel more than 50km from their nearest public health facility to access specialist medical services. An additional $16bn will also be invested in regional infrastructure projects across the state, including for the CopperString 2.0 transmission project, long-duration pumped hydro projects, the Fitzroy to Gladstone pipeline and the Burdekin Falls dam. Losers The coal lobby The Palaszczuk government has stood its ground on progressive coal royalties introduced last year, despite fierce criticism from the Queensland Resources Council, which has run a $40m advertising campaign against the scheme. Dick said the increased tax was the reason the government was able to invest more than $8bn in a range of cost-of-living measures and pay down the state\u2019s debt. \u201cOur decision, to take on the mining lobby, to stand our ground, and to fight for the people of our state, has delivered a rich reward for Queenslanders,\u201d he said. Vulnerable children and families The budget papers show clearly the state\u2019s priorities have shifted when it comes to helping vulnerable children and families. There is money to hire more youth justice workers, and more police. But at the same time, staffing numbers for next year have been cut \u2013 in actual terms \u2013 from the department responsible for child safety, seniors and disability services. Renters and people in housing stress The Queensland government will spend an additional $1.1bn for social and affordable housing, with $250m slated for housing and homelessness support services. It promises 1,200 new dwellings via a build-to-rent pilot program. The government says these measures will strengthen housing supply, but community organisations say a much more aggressive response is needed. The Queensland Council of Social Services \u201ccalled into question the government\u2019s commitment to putting a roof over the head of every Queenslander\u201d saying that pre-budget announcements did not go far enough.", "Schools funding and reforms panel: five key takeaways [2023-12-11T14:00:38Z]": "An expert panel has released its much-anticipated review into Australia\u2019s education system which is set to inform the next five years of funding and reforms. Education ministers will now begin negotiations on the next national school reform agreement (NSRA), which was delayed until 2025 for the review to be conducted. Over the course of the year, the panel, chaired by Dr Lisa O\u2019Brien, visited 92 schools, held more than 130 meetings and surveyed about 25,000 parents, teachers and students. Here are five key takeaways. 1. Fully funding public schools More than a decade since the landmark Gonski review recommended changes to fund Australian schools according to need, 98% of public schools remain under-resourced.   Related: Australian public schools must be fully funded \u2018as soon as possible\u2019, independent review finds    That\u2019s according to the schooling resource standard (SRS), the minimum baseline agreed to by governments for students to access a decent education. Just the Australian Capital Territory has reached it, and on its current trajectory, the Northern Territory never will. Equity is the centrepiece of the report, with its panel noting disadvantaged students are three times more likely to fall behind their classmates, while Australian schools also have some of the highest levels of social segregation among OECD countries. The panel said full funding to 100% of the SRS was a \u201ccritical prerequisite\u201d for successful education reform, learning and wellbeing improvement across the country. \u201cThe uneven playing field and funding shortfalls the Gonski reviews sought to correct persist and need to be addressed,\u201d the report read.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  \u201cIt is crucial that all governments and school systems aim to achieve 100% of the SRS for every school as soon as possible \u2026 in particular, the panel notes the special circumstances of the NT, which may require additional support.\u201d The commonwealth has committed to work with state and territory governments to get every school to 100% of the SRS. Negotiations will now begin on when \u2013 and if \u2013 a target will be introduced. 2. Screening student progress The report found too many children were falling behind in early years and failing to catch up to their peers. It has called for consistent universal screening of student progress in fundamental literacy and numeracy skills from year 1, with targeted programs like small group or individual catch-up tutoring to be offered to children failing to meet standards. \u201cThe significant proportion of students who are falling behind indicates that despite the significant efforts of systems and schools, current approaches are not providing all students with foundational literacy and numeracy skills,\u201d the report read. \u201cUniversal screening is the most effective and cost-efficient way to ensure any student at risk of falling behind in their learning is identified early and given the help they need to catch up.\u201d The year 1 phonics check would be rolled out to all schools by the end of 2026, with a numeracy check to follow by the end of 2028. The data would be reported nationally. 3. Schools to act as community hubs The role of schools as education providers would be radically expanded to better integrate with other community services under the review\u2019s recommendations. The panel found \u201cfar too many students\u201d fell behind because they struggled to access supports they needed, including in allied health. It cited data suggesting students with poor mental health had more than double the number of absent days than their peers and, by year 9, were up to 2.8 years behind in literacy and numeracy. \u201cPsychological distress has increased among young people over the last 10 years \u2026 in some places, there is a cluttered and fragmented landscape of supports which can be difficult for students, families and schools to navigate,\u201d the report read. Placing wellbeing at the centre, dedicated in-school functions like speech and occupational therapists and wellbeing coordinators would be offered in schools to provide referrals to counsellors and psychologists. In addition, the panel has called for a national student wellbeing measure to be implemented by the end of 2028, collecting data on belonging, safety, engagement and classroom disruption. 4. Addressing workforce shortages The report has recommended new subject-specific roles for top teachers and learning opportunities to raise the status of the profession to reverse major workforce shortages and retain employees. The centrepiece is a new national career pathway frameworks to be established by the end of 2027, to recognise accreditation for courses like micro-credentials and better deploy expertise. It includes the establishment of two new subject-specific roles for teachers, including a school-based \u201cinstructional specialist\u201d and region-based \u201cmaster teachers\u201d, selected via a competitive process. The panel also recommended improving access to high-quality teaching resources.   Related: Flexible schooling: how it sparked a \u2018hysterical\u2019 response and what families really think    \u201cMany teachers do not feel adequately recognised or valued, despite competitive starting salaries,\u201d the report read. \u201cBetter incentives, enhanced career pathways and better employment conditions are needed to attract and retain teachers and school staff. \u201cAttrition rates are high, with around one in five beginning teachers leaving within the first three years \u2026 despite the efforts of school systems and approved authorities, teachers feel overworked.\u201d Additionally, the panel argued more must be done to ensure the workforce was diverse, including increasing First Nations educators to address cultural safety and racism in schools. 5. A \u2018data custodian\u2019 Too many data gaps exist in the education sector, the panel warned, particularly amongst priority equity cohorts including students with disabilities. It\u2019s recommended wide-ranging reforms to data collection, transparency and accountability, to better track students and advise the community where needs-based funding is being directed \u2013 and how it\u2019s being used. \u201cThere is a lack of transparency and accountability in current funding arrangements tracing back over decades,\u201d the report read. \u201cFamilies and communities do not have visibility of how public funding is allocated and expended, particularly in relation to how needs-based loadings flow through to schools. \u201cOur system is falling short of community expectations of transparency and limit our understanding of how investment or policy changes may impact student outcomes.\u201d To fill the gaps, an independent body would become a \u201cdata custodian\u201d by the end of 2026, tasked with developing a more \u201cmature\u201d approach to governance and data-sharing.", "Queensland health boss resigns amid criticism of proposed whistleblower law change [2023-06-28T03:37:37Z]": "The Queensland Health boss will step down from his role at the end of this month amid ongoing criticism of proposed changes to whistleblower laws made by the department. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, confirmed on Wednesday that Shaun Drummond, the director general of Queensland Health, had written her a letter confirming his resignation after being in the role for less than a year. The premier said he had done \u201can excellent job as the head of the department\u201d and clarified that it was his decision to resign. \u201cI thank him for his service to Queenslanders. It is a very, very difficult job. And he has served very well in that position,\u201d she told reporters. Palaszczuk also said she supported whistleblowers being able to come forward with reports. Earlier this week, the Sunday Mail reported on a submission by Queensland Health to the inquiry into public interest disclosure laws that suggested whistleblowers who provide journalists with \u201cinappropriate\u201d information should be penalised. After days of negative headlines, Drummond attempted to distance himself from his department\u2019s suggestions in a letter to the Courier-Mail. He said the submission about the laws had not come from him personally and he did not aim to restrict press freedom.

As attorney general, Fentiman said last year she was committed to extending the laws to the state\u2019s corruption body. Speaking to journalists on Wednesday in her new role as health minister, Fentiman backed Drummond and said he had her support. \u201cI have confidence with the director general and, as I said, so far the department have been responsive to my priorities as a new minister in terms of tackling ambulance ramping and pressures on our hospital system,\u201d she said. Fentiman clarified she had been clear in the media she did not support penalties for the disclosure of information to journalists.

Four senior ministers \u2013 including the premier, Steven Miles - walked through the doors. Attendees describe what happened next as \u201clike an ambush\u201d. Multiple sources say the ministers justified the changes \u2013 to erase the human rights principle of \u201cdetention as a last resort\u201d for children \u2013 as necessary to stop ongoing political attacks by the Liberal National party.   Related: Queensland Labor to remove principle of detention as last resort from Youth Justice Act    There it is. The quiet part out loud. Confirmation to many of those present that this is not just a government on life support; it\u2019s a government that has lost all perspective, deluded in the belief that \u2013 by borrowing the hardcore policies of its opponent \u2013 it remains somehow a more palatable choice. What Miles and Labor have inadvertently proved, again, is that the party is willing to abandon long-held principles and evidence-based policy in the face of an election defeat. In 2019, the youth justice minister, Di Farmer, told the state parliament she knew that if the state took a punitive approach to young offenders, there was an \u201calmost 100% chance\u201d they would reoffend. Months later, with the 2020 election on the horizon, the government changed bail laws to introduce a presumption against bail for some children. The flow-on impact was more children in youth detention and police watch houses, where conditions have worsened.   Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Farmer\u2019s prediction came true: experts say many of the youth justice issues in communities are because children in custody are offered little schooling or rehabilitation and inevitably reoffend. Labor politicians repeatedly rubbished the LNP\u2019s policy to introduce an offence for \u201cbreach of bail\u201d. Then they suspended the Human Rights Act and adopted the policy. In Cabinet last year, the police minister, Mark Ryan, walked in with a powerpoint and argued that the changes were needed to stop political attacks by the LNP. \u201cEvery news story about another incident would come with a line from the LNP saying the solution was [for] breach of bail [to be made an offence for children],\u201d a Labor minister said at the time. \u201cNow [if the LNP campaigns on youth crime at the election] we can turn around and say, \u2018well, we did what you wanted us to do\u2019.\u201d Of course, that didn\u2019t work. The opposition leader, David Crisafulli, turned his attention to the idea of \u201cdetention as a last resort\u201d. He talks about it on an almost daily basis, particularly in regional cities like Townsville and Cairns. Earlier this year, Miles was defiant about the need to use detention only as a last resort for children. He said: \u201cAll of the evidence suggests that if you detain offenders for low-level offences you expose them to hardened criminals, you expose them to gangs, you make it much more likely they will reoffend. \u201cBut that LNP policy is incredibly dangerous... you\u2019d actually make the situation worse,\u201d Miles said.  It\u2019s now Labor policy, too. Labor sources say the youth crime debate has become so constant and damaging that the party desperately needed some clear air to sell other policies. There\u2019s a belief that Crisafulli is walking into office with no detail or substance behind his attack lines. \u201cWe need to get back to fighting on other issues,\u201d one MP said. \u201cWe can\u2019t win an election on youth crime. We just need to move on\u201d. Last month, a \u201cbipartisan\u201d committee looking at youth justice policy collapsed. Establishing the committee in the first place was a government strategy to attempt to neutralise the youth crime issue.  The logic of then premier Annastacia Palaszczuk was to establish a sort of war cabinet, adopt its recommendations and move on with a suite of policies endorsed by the LNP. But six months before the state election \u2013 and to no one\u2019s shock \u2013 the major parties couldn\u2019t agree on a way forward and the committee disbanded.  The idea that the LNP will simply take its win and move on to other issues defies logic.   Related: Queensland\u2019s $1.28bn community safety plan includes transporting detained children for schooling    Meanwhile, there are real-world consequences to any decision that has the impact of putting more children into custody. The number of children in adult police watch houses \u2013 where they are being held for weeks on end due to overcrowding in detention \u2013 are higher than ever. In February a 13-year-old boy was allegedly sexually assaulted in the Cairns watch house by an older, larger boy. Police admit they \u201ccannot meet\u201d expectations for young people while also dealing with adult prisoners. Psychologists have warned of incidents and deteriorating mental health conditions. The youth justice minister knows it to be true. She said herself; these children are almost certain to reoffend. The premier knows it to be true. He said it himself; children detained for low-level offences are more likely to reoffend. Every lurch to the right on youth justice just makes our communities less safe. The irony is inescapable. On Wednesday, morning, as the police minister introduced the bill, some year 6 children from a Brisbane state school walked into the legislative assembly chamber to watch the proceedings. As is customary, MPs smiled up at the kids and waved. Then got on with the job of passing legislation that will put more kids their age \u2013 11 and 12 \u2013 behind bars.", "Queensland budget 2023: coal royalty boom funds $550 energy rebate, free kindergarten and a record surplus [2023-06-13T05:33:36Z]": "The Queensland government\u2019s controversial decision to increase royalties on record-high coal prices has contributed to an unexpected $10bn revenue windfall and a record surplus, allowing the state to fund cost-of-living relief, including free kindergarten classes and $550 electricity rebates for all households. The treasurer, Cameron Dick, on Tuesday handed down Queensland\u2019s 2023-24 budget, which offered a rare opportunity for a government to pitch itself to economic conservatives \u2013 via a record surplus and debt reduction \u2013 while at the same time spending big on households struggling with inflationary pressures. At the heart of this year\u2019s budget is the increased revenue generated by coal royalty hikes \u2013 a measure announced last year that has faced significant opposition from the mining sector, including a $40m advertising campaign by the Queensland Resources Council. The budget papers reveal income of more than $15bn from coal royalties in 2022-23 \u2013 about $10bn more than had been forecast 12 months ago \u2013 due mainly to sustained high coal prices, which trigger the increased royalty rates. The boost has allowed the government to frame its 2023-24 budget as a Robin Hood-style affair \u2013 portraying miners as greedy for complaining while they rake in super profits, while marking the budget papers with a \u201ctackling the cost of living\u201d stamp.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  \u201cWe can deliver our state\u2019s biggest cost-of-living program, our state\u2019s biggest building program and deliver lower debt for one simple reason \u2013 progressive coal royalties,\u201d Dick said. \u201cOur decision to take on the mining lobby, to stand our ground and to fight for the people of our state has delivered a rich reward.\u201d The increased royalties income are set to push the 2022-23 surplus to $12.3bn, which Dick said was the largest recorded by a state or territory government. The budget predicts Queensland will run a $2.2bn deficit next year, largely due to one-off spending measures. Coal royalties also helped the state temporarily reduce net debt, which is now $5.9bn, instead of the $19.8bn forecast 12 months ago. By 2026-27, debt levels will have climbed back to almost $47bn, largely due to infrastructure spending. Queensland will spend $8.2bn in 2023-24 on cost-of-living relief, including a $550 energy rebate for every household, with concession holders to receive an additional $150 discount on top of an existing $372 rebate, taking total support for this group to $1,072 in 2023-24. Dick said the rebate was the most generous of all the states and territories and meant many Queenslanders won\u2019t pay for electricity at all next year. He said the rebates were a deliberate measure to assist households in a way that is deflationary, rather than putting cash directly into people\u2019s pockets and potentially contributing to further inflation. The government has also announced it will fully subsidise 15 hours a week of kindergarten (in Queensland kindy is the year before children start school). The measure is expected to save Queenslanders up to $4,600 a year in fees. \u201cIt gives more Queenslanders the opportunity to return to work or to take on more work,\u201d Dick said. \u201cWe understand the economic potential that is unlocked by enabling more women to get back into the workforce.\u201d   Related: Guardian Essential poll: voters trust Labor over Coalition to manage cost of living and inflation    Dick also boasted a record $89bn will be invested in the state\u2019s \u201cbig build\u201d program over the next four years. The program will help provide critical infrastructure across the state ahead of the 2032 Olympic Games. Those measures come on top of increased funding for health, housing and youth justice \u2013 all areas where the state government has found itself under political pressure in recent months. Almost $2.9bn extra will be spent on health services over the next five years, including measures to reduce ambulance ramping and boost the state\u2019s patient travel subsidy scheme. The government will increase funding for social and affordable housing to $1.1bn, with $250m slated for housing and homelessness support services. Youth crime is another focus of this year\u2019s budget. The government has allocated $440m over five years for youth co-responder teams, policing and to help seniors secure their homes. \u201cThis budget delivers what the people of Queensland need: comprehensive cost-of-living relief,\u201d Dick said. \u201cNo other government in Australia could promise this. And no other government in Australia could deliver what this budget delivers for Queensland.\u201d The opposition Liberal National party said the budget failed to deliver long-term solutions to the cost-of-living, youth crime, health and housing crises. Shadow treasurer David Janetzki said Queensland would have \u201cnothing to show\u201d for the billions of dollars more than was previously forecast. \u201cAfter the rivers of gold dry up, Queensland will have nothing to show but the highest debt in our state\u2019s history, the highest taxes and failing frontline services,\u201d Janetzki said. The Queensland Resources Council chief executive, Ian Macfarlane, said the budget \u201crevealed the true extent in which Queensland relies on the resources sector\u201d. But the former federal Liberal resources minister said investor confidence had been \u201cshattered\u201d by the coal royalty increase and it would be an \u201cenormous hit on the future viability\u201d of the industry. The Queensland Council of Social Service chief executive, Aimee McVeigh, welcomed rebates on power that would benefit all Queensland households and that would likely see some low-income households not pay electricity bills at all for the next financial year. \u201cPeople have been not turning on heaters, not turning on lights and not using power because of the pressure that the cost of energy is putting on household budgets,\u201d she said.", "Queensland man who died after snake bite incident on weekend did not have venom in system [2023-09-14T04:03:03Z]": "A Queensland man who was thought to have died from a snake bite on the weekend when helping a friend did not have any venom in his body, a toxicology report has found.

Plans to increase taxes on the miners have been historically fraught. Meanwhile, the wounds inflicted on Labor by the Adani saga still feel fresh. And this is Queensland, where the black rock is still king, and critical to the state\u2019s economy and its identity.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Cameron Dick\u2019s latest budget, flush with $15.3bn income from coal royalties, has brought the bigger picture into focus. Labor is running a version of Muhammad Ali\u2019s famous \u201crope a dope\u201d strategy \u2013 inviting superficial attacks and leaving opponents\u2019 weaknesses badly exposed. Everything voters might want \u2013 a budget surplus, debt reduction, cost-of-living handouts, infrastructure projects, new housing, health funding \u2013 is now linked to the decision to increase royalties on unprecedented profits. In Dick\u2019s words, the royalties \u201cunderpin everything that we are doing\u201d. \u201cA Queensland without progressive coal royalties \u2026 means there will be no cost-of-living relief, cancelled infrastructure programs, cuts to services, and a higher debt burden. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a credible opinion on this budget without having a credible opinion on royalties. [Opposition leader David Crisafulli] needs to accept that, or he needs to start cutting back on the $89bn capital program and tell Queenslanders what he\u2019s not going to build.\u201d If this is starting to sound familiar, it\u2019s because it is. These are versions of the same attack lines on potential LNP cuts that Labor used in 2020. And 2017. And 2015. The only thing missing was the dark spectre of Campbell Newman, dressed like death and carrying a scythe. Labor uses these lines again and again because they are effective. Queenslanders want public services and publicly-owned assets. If the LNP opposition offers anything other than full-throated support for the coal royalties, they\u2019ll be fodder for Labor\u2019s attacks (and scares) about hidden cuts. Last year, Dick warned the mining industry that its campaign \u2013 reportedly costing $40m in advertising \u2013 could backfire and damage the sector\u2019s social licence. On Monday, the day before the state budget, Dick told the Queensland Resources Council to \u201cshow some respect\u201d while coalminers were making record profits and households were struggling with the cost of living. There is no question that the decision to increase royalties has put Queensland on a stronger economic footing coming out of the pandemic. It has helped the state pay for significant cost-of-living relief measures and long-overdue programs like free kindy for preschoolers. But the true irony here is that, by the next election, the impact of the state\u2019s royalty changes will have largely disappeared. The system was designed so that miners paid higher rates while export prices were at extraordinary and record highs. When global shocks end, and coal prices return to normal, so do the royalty rates. Subsequently, most of the spending is on one-off measures. Over the next four years, the state budget anticipates \u201ca sharp decline\u201d in coal prices and for royalties income to drop below long-term averages. Most of the extra money being fought over is already in the coffers. So by the time all of this public debate has played out, on election day in October next year, the argument will be largely academic anyway.", "Scientific body given just $100,000 a year to fight deadly fire ants, Senate inquiry told [2024-03-19T10:19:06Z]": "Australia\u2019s leading scientific research body received just $100,000 a year towards combatting fire ants, a Senate inquiry into the highly invasive pests has heard. \nAt the third and final session of public hearings for the Senate inquiry on Monday, the committee\u2019s chair, Senator Matt Canavan, said some of the evidence he had heard had \u201cfreaked [him] out\u201d. \nRed imported fire ants (Rifa) are believed to have entered Australia in the 1990s and were discovered at Brisbane port in 2001. A program spanning state, territory and federal governments was created to eradicate Rifa and has been allocated more than $1.2bn of federal and state funding. Of that, $593m covers 2023 to 2027. \nBut the CSIRO\u2019s executive director of future industries, Kirsten Rose, said the agency has only received about $1m \u2013 most of it government funded \u2013 towards combatting fire ants over the last 10 years, despite pioneering research in Rifa management including the development of a Rifa-specific novel genetic bait and drone surveillance technology. \n \n  Related: \u2018Wildly toxic\u2019 poison used on fire ants is killing native Australian animals, experts warn Senate inquiry  \n \nCanavan, the chair of the Senate rural and regional affairs and transport references committee, said that $100,000 a year \u201cdoesn\u2019t sound like a lot\u201d. \nFunds were more likely to be diverted to urgent eradication operations and other research bodies were also researching fire ants, the committee heard. \nRose was one of many witnesses who called for more funding towards eliminating the extremely damaging pest, which has now spread to more than 700,000 hectares in south-east Queensland amid a spate of recent detections in northern New South Wales. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nAngus Atkinson, the chair of the National Farmers\u2019 Federation\u2019s sustainable development and climate change committee, said he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about resourcing of the program and that farmers \u201cwould be really happy\u201d to be part of its governance. \n\u201cWe only manage 50% of the continent,\u201d he said, referencing the amount of Australian land dedicated to farms and agriculture. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to involve us.\u201d \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nOver three days of hearings, the committee heard scores of testimonies underlining the immense scope of the problem. \n95% of Australia\u2019s landmass is suited to fire ants, according to the Invasive Species Council. Should the ants spread through Australia\u2019s habitat, the impact would be worse than the combined effects of rabbits, cane toads, foxes, camels, wild dogs and feral cats. \nUp to 650,000 Australians could be stung each year and the beef industry could be slashed by 40%. \n\u201cIt freaked me out, some of the briefings I\u2019ve had about the potential ramifications [of fire ants],\u201d Canavan said on Monday. \nMeanwhile, environmental experts have pushed back against claims made to the committee that chemicals used to kill fire ants may impact native fauna. \nJack Gough of the Invasive Species Council said that concerns over the health and environmental impacts of the pesticide fipronil in the fight against fire ants did not reflect the highly targeted and low levels at which the chemical is used by the eradication program. \n\u201cThis is being done in a targeted fashion at very low doses in ways that aren\u2019t comparable to the broad scale use of fipronil on crops. They are just such wildly different scales of use,\u201d he said. \n\u201cFipronil at high doses used indiscriminately clearly has high environmental impacts, particularly on insect populations. \n\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no way the way it is being used [on fire ants] is going to have an impact on native animals, other than some highly localised impacts on native ants species that will quickly recolonise once fire ants have been removed from the area,\u201d he said. \nHe said the council had visited cane farms in Queensland where fire ants nests that had been injected with fipronil were now home to native ants. \n\u201cThe reality is that fire ants are a disaster for our native wildlife and their impacts far outweigh the very small localised impacts of this chemical,\u201d he said.", "Labor\u2019s refusal to tie public hospital funding to full reproductive care condemned as \u2018outrageous\u2019 [2023-09-05T15:00:34Z]": "Despite harrowing stories from women about having to \u201cshop around\u201d for abortion care even when their pregnancies are unviable, the federal government will not make providing abortion services a condition tied to millions of dollars in funding it allocates to major public hospitals.

Related: \u2018I was shocked\u2019: Catholic-run public hospitals refuse to provide birth control and abortion    When it delivered its final report in May, the Senate inquiry into reproductive healthcare access recommended increased accessibility of abortion services at public hospitals. But the inquiry fell short of making it a requirement in order to receive public funding. In 2019, the then shadow minister for women, Tanya Plibersek, indicated Labor would tie funding to public hospitals with willingness to provide abortion services, a policy since dumped by federal Labor. When Guardian Australia asked the prime minister\u2019s office whether Labor would revert to its 2019 policy, it was referred to the assistant minister for health and aged care, Ged Kearney, who did not respond to questions about whether she supported calls to make federal funding conditional on providing full reproductive care. \u201cAll Australians deserve equitable access to the healthcare that they need,\u201d she said. Without reform to funding policies, Dr Ronli Sifris, the deputy director of the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law at Monash University, said the disturbing inequities detailed by Guardian Australia would continue. \u201cThe fact that public hospitals in Australia are legally able to conscientiously object means the vast majority of abortions are provided through the private sector,\u201d Sifris said. \u201cThis is unacceptable.

After getting the results of a scan, if there is a problem, these women can\u2019t stay there and be treated and cared for. They then are transferred to another hospital to undergo further treatment and have the termination. \u201cI think in situations where women are already traumatised and stressed that making them travel like that is absolutely not OK, to find it\u2019s not possible due to these crazy religiously driven restrictions on services.

Caldwell is considered the favourite given his ties to the electorate and profile as the council representative for the area, while Palipana is considered a frontrunner for the next state election. Fadden has been held by the LNP every election bar one since 1977. At the last election, Robert won it with a 10.6% margin, despite an almost 5% swing against him.

The whistleblower also claimed that police investigations into corruption within the PNG immigration and citizenship authority (ICA) were abandoned under political pressure not to investigate. The whistleblower, a current employee of the ICA, alleged there was documentary evidence supporting claims \u201cthe Australian taxpayer funding allocation for the management of refugees under the PNG Humanitarian Program has been depleted or gone missing\u201d.

And the officers who have raised those allegations will be asked to provide any facts, any evidence, so we are able to conclude this matter,\u201d Hulahau said. The allegations relate to the PNG Humanitarian Program (PHP), established to provide support and welfare for the final refugees and asylum seekers left in PNG after the closure of Australia\u2019s illegal offshore detention centre on Manus Island. Shrouded in secrecy Australia funded PNG\u2019s Humanitarian Program through a secret contract signed in 2021 by the Morrison government \u2013 the details of which the Albanese government still refuses to reveal. The money was provided out of Australia\u2019s $303m irregular maritime arrival \u201coffshore management\u201d budget and sent to PNG\u2019s immigration and citizenship authority, from where it has been paid to PNG private contractors to provide accommodation, groceries, medical care and transport to refugees and asylum seekers.

In a letter dated 9 October, the whistleblower alleged widespread corruption \u2013 particularly around the hiring of cars. He claimed private vehicles were \u201ccross-hired\u201d so as to disguise the beneficiaries of contracts, and relatives of senior officials were allowing their private vehicles to be hired through a front company, in order to claim a personal benefit. The whistleblower also claimed contracts were improperly awarded, without an open tender process, and given to companies with no experience providing the services required.

Palaszczuk was in Mackay on Thursday to unveil details about the proposed Pioneer-Burdekin project, which will take about a decade to plan and build. She said the 5GW project was the \u201ccentrepiece\u201d of the Queensland energy plan announced Wednesday, which envisages large-scale construction of renewables and the early closure of coal-fired generators. Under the plan, reliance on burning coal would cease by about 2035.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning  However the Pioneer-Burdekin project remains in the very early stages and still requires significant planning and funding. The government said while it was confident the proposal is viable, it would continue to assess potential backup options.   Related: Queensland government pledges to end reliance on coal-fired power by 2035    The estimated cost for the project is $12bn. The Queensland government is yet to commit any money, though the project would probably not begin construction until 2025 at the earliest. It is expected the state would seek a significant federal contribution to the construction cost. \u201cI\u2019ve had very preliminary first conversations with the prime minister, and I know how much he is interested in nation-building infrastructure,\u201d Palaszczuk said. Queensland Hydro, the new government entity designated to build the project, is expected to complete detailed geotechnical and environmental studies in 2024. In the meantime, the organisation will \u201calso continue to investigate other large-scale, long-duration pumped hydro sites in the event the project is unable to proceed,\u201d a government statement said. On Thursday Palaszczuk and the state\u2019s energy minister, Mick de Brenni, said about 50 homes would be inundated under the plans, which involve the construction of three reservoirs. Negotiations will need to be conducted with the land owners and with Indigenous traditional owners. Environmental groups have largely welcomed the state\u2019s renewable ambitions outlined in the energy plan. But some have also raised concern about the impacts of projects like the Pioneer-Burdekin. The Mackay Conservation Group on Thursday said it was concerned about the local environmental impacts of the project. \u201cAll of the water in the Pioneer catchment is already fully allocated for farmers, drinking water, and environmental flows,\u201d said the group\u2019s coordinator, Peter McCallum. \u201cThere simply is no available unallocated water to operate a pumped hydro scheme under the Pioneer valley water plan. One of these stakeholders will have to suffer. \u201cWe are also very concerned about the impacts that any clearing for the project will have on the iconic Eungella national park which is one of the jewels in the crown for Mackay biodiversity and tourism.\u201d Palaszczuk said part of the attraction of the site west of Mackay was that farmland and cane fields \u2013 rather than national parks \u2013 would be inundated to create the reservoirs.

The available evidence on the impact of Headspace includes studies with relatively small sample sizes, the largest of which was a study of 2,222 participants from 2008\u201309. This represents less than o.5% of the 700,000 young people seen by Headspace since 2006. It meant many existing studies were \u201c\u2026 either underpowered to detect an effect, or that the findings were unrepresentative and lacked generalisability\u201d, Kisely and his co-author wrote. \u201cAs a result, the ongoing level of uncertainty in the strength of the available evidence seems inconsistent with the current generous funding of Headspace.\u201d The paper suggests redirecting funds elsewhere, such as to primary care or under-resourced state-provided mental health services.

The CEO of Headspace, Jason Trethowan, described the paper as \u201cbiased\u201d and \u201cmisleading\u201d. He said it \u201cmisrepresents Headspace and makes irrelevant and inappropriate claims\u201d. \u201cOver the past 16 years, Headspace has provided more than four million services and supported over 700,000 young people at our centres right across the country,\u201d Trethowan said. He referred to a preprint study yet to undergo peer review which examined the outcomes of young people accessing supports at Headspace for mental health problems. \u201cThe results were based on the experiences of more than 50,000 young people accessing the service between April 2019 and March 2020, making it the largest study of its kind on Headspace to date,\u201d Trethowan said. The study found more than 70% of young people who sought help at Headspace centres improved in at least one of the three outcomes, including psychological distress, social and occupational functioning, and self-reported quality of life. Just under half of young people improved in self-reported quality of life, over one-third had significant improvements in psychological distress, and a similar proportion improved in psychosocial functioning.

A landmark review into sex work by the Queensland Law Reform Commission has made 47 recommendations, including scrapping the Prostitution Licensing Authority, repealing some police powers and allowing services to be advertised on radio and TV. The QLRC also recommended that sex workers not be singled out for public soliciting or street-based sex work, and said planning rules should allow services to operate away from industrial zones.

A report by Save the Children labelled Queensland as one of the worst offenders in Australia when it comes to violating children\u2019s rights in the youth justice system. Lewis said Queensland must follow the example of Scotland, which had committed to enshrining the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child into law, making it illegal for public authorities to act incompatibly with its requirements. Scotland had established a three-year action plan for children, with their rights dispersed across different government portfolios.

The Queensland treasurer, Cameron Dick, said the state would record an unexpected $1.9bn surplus in 2021-22 off the back of surging prices for fossil fuels, although a small deficit is forecast next financial year. The centrepiece of the budget is a $23.6bn investment in healthcare \u2013 an increase of $1.2bn, roughly 6% \u2013 that would include measures to hire 9,450 healthcare workers, build three new hospitals and add 2,200 new hospital beds.

Dick said the old royalty rates structure for coal was \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d. Miners will now pay 20% for prices above $175 a tonne, 30% for prices above $225 a tonne, and 40% for prices above $300 a tonne.

Even in cities, Price said, current Medicare funding levels were turning graduates away from general practice. \n\u201cWe know that only 15% of medical graduates are looking to enter general practice, which is down from 50%. When you\u2019ve got kids and Hecs debt after a long course, it can be more attractive to stay in a hospital job with leave and other entitlements, rather than become a GP.\u201d \nPrice noted that the Australian Medical Association recommends GPs charge $86 for a standard consult, and that if they don\u2019t charge this, \u201cthey\u2019re basically discounting their work\u201d. \n  \n  \n   \n     \n    \n    Email:&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\n    \n    \n    App:&nbsp;download our free app&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories\n    \n    \n    Social:&nbsp;follow us on YouTube,&nbsp;TikTok,&nbsp;Instagram,&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;or&nbsp;Twitter\n    \n    \n    Podcast:&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;Apple Podcasts,&nbsp;Spotify&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\n    \n   \n  \n  \n \nPrice said she had observed a recent spike in practices moving away from being entirely bulk-billed, and others being forced to close down, and believed this was in part because Medicare funding was outdated. \n\u201cOur healthcare has become more complex. We have an ageing population, and mental health and complex chronic conditions are more common. They require consultations but are not valued by Medicare in the same way. You\u2019ll earn more if you see three patients in the time it takes for an extended appointment for one patient,\u201d Price said. \nAdditionally, Price pointed to the increased cost of paying staff, acquiring and maintaining new computers and technologies used to treat patients, and the price of PPE that soared during the pandemic, as reasons why some GPs were forced to increase their out-of-pocket costs. \n  \n  \n   default\n  \n  \n \nDr Stephen Duckett, a Grattan Institute health economist and former secretary of what is now the Department of Health, echoed Price\u2019s concerns that general practice was underfunded and graduates were turning away from the career, but said \u201cthe right answer may not be by increasing the rebate\u201d. \n\u201cWe want to reshape the way primary medical care works \u2026 so exploring funding that increases the incentive for continuity, to reward GPs for building a relationship with patients, which can allow them to be more proactive in their care with things such as phone checkups. \n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to invest more money in general practice. And we can\u2019t ignore that if you\u2019re leaving medical school today, the choice between being a GP and a cardiologist is five times as much money, so we have to start addressing that,\u201d Duckett said. \nWhat the political parties say \nThe opposition health spokesperson, Mark Butler, did not directly answer if Labor would increase the Medicare rebate, but said \u201cLabor will always strengthen and protect Medicare, we\u2019ll have more to say during the campaign\u201d. \n\u201cUnder Scott Morrison it\u2019s never been harder or more expensive to see a GP. \n \n  Related: Campaign catchup: Are we in for a repeat of Mediscare?  \n \n\u201cWe know that when people can\u2019t afford to see the GP they either end up in overwhelmed emergency departments or just put off getting the healthcare they need,\u201d Butler said, also pointing out Labor\u2019s urgent care clinic commitment. \nGuardian Australia asked Greg Hunt, the outgoing health minister, if the Morrison government planned to increase the Medicare rebate. \nA spokesperson did not answer directly, but referred Guardian Australia to the figure that 89% of GP services are bulk-billed, and said that \u201cthe Morrison government is committed to not just supporting GPs, but also supporting their patients\u201d. \n\u201cIn terms of funding, Medicare was $19bn under Labor and is $31bn this year growing to almost $36bn over the forward estimates,\u201d the spokesperson said.", "\u2018The model is broken\u2019: Brisbane live music venue the Zoo to close after 32 years [2024-04-30T23:37:40Z]": "The Brisbane music venue the Zoo will call last drinks in July, with the owner listing a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of forces leading to its closure, including cost-of-living pressures and declining alcohol consumption among young people. The 500-capacity room, which first opened its doors on Ann Street in 1992 in the formerly down-at-heel but now heavily gentrified inner suburb of Fortitude Valley, is one of Australia\u2019s oldest music venues. The Zoo\u2019s sister venue, the 250-capacity Stranded, will also close its doors at the end of this week. Stranded, housed in the same building as the Zoo, was named after the 1976 debut single by the legendary Brisbane band the Saints.   Related: \u2018If you came to The Zoo, you respected the rules\u2019: is this Brisbane music venue the best in Australia?    The Zoo\u2019s owner, Shane Chidgzey, said the venue\u2019s current revenue was at roughly 60% of the previous financial year. \u201cThe model is broken, unfortunately, when it comes to music venues,\u201d he said. \u201cWe only make money on alcohol sales. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a cost-of-living crisis in Australia, which is huge \u2026 And there\u2019s a new trend of not drinking, which is a wonderful trend for health but not so good for bars.\u201d The Zoo\u2019s booker, Nathan Farrell, told the Guardian in March that while more tickets were sold in 2023 than in any year in the Zoo history, the amount of money people were spending on drinks once through the door was well down. Chidgzey also cited audiences saving their money for big-ticket international artists including Taylor Swift, as well as the skyrocketing cost of insurance, which had nearly doubled in the past two years from $35,000 to $65,000.    Chidgzey said the venue\u2019s increased insurance costs were partially driven by the venue\u2019s location in a safe night precinct, a Queensland government initiative to curb alcohol-related violence in entertainment zones that began in 2014. There has been only one insurance claim in the venue\u2019s history.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The Zoo\u2019s location in the precinct, Chidgzey said, put it at a profound financial disadvantage. \u201cIt requires additional security, it requires ID scanners, it requires more regulation, your insurance is more expensive and your rent\u2019s more expensive,\u201d he said. Other comparable venues such as the Tivoli, also in Fortitude Valley, the Triffid in neighbouring Newstead and the Princess Theatre in South Brisbane are not in the safe night precinct, according to Chidgzey: \u201cThey\u2019re working on a completely different cost basis to us.\u201d He also called for the introduction of a levy on major international touring artists to subsidise the grassroots music industry. \u201cThey need to be putting a dollar transaction per ticket on that to put into local music.\u201d The venue\u2019s original owner Joc Curran, who ran the venue from 1992 to 2016, said: \u201cThe Zoo was an impossible thing, that became possible because of community, love, and a belief that magic could happen \u2026 but now it is time to say goodnight.\u201d Curran said she was only one of the venue\u2019s custodians, paying tribute to her original co-owner C Smith, Chidgzey, the former owners Pixie Weyand, Cat Clarke and Luke \u201cBoo\u201d Johnston, as well as the \u201cZooies\u201d \u2013 a term of endearment for the venue\u2019s long-term staffers.    Robert Forster, who co-founded the Brisbane band the Go-Betweens with the late Grant McLennan in the late 1970s, said the Zoo was \u201cthe first well-run, stable, encouraging, well-organised venue in Brisbane that I\u2019d ever encountered\u201d. \u201cPermanence had very little to do with the Brisbane scene up until the 1990s, and it really started with Joc and C going down to the Valley.\u201d Forster moved back to Brisbane from Germany in 1992, the same year of the Zoo\u2019s inception. \u201cIt had a tonne of atmosphere and it always felt like a meeting place and a hangout,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was great that it was one storey up above the whole mad, ugly chaos of the Valley.\u201d   Related: Australia\u2019s live music scene \u2018decimated\u2019, with 1,300 venues lost since pandemic    Later, after McLennan also moved back to Brisbane, he and Forster formed a new lineup of the Go-Betweens which made its debut at the Zoo in December 1995. Other notable shows at the venue included an early 1996 performance by Nick Cave with the Dirty Three (marking the beginning of Cave\u2019s working relationship with Warren Ellis) as well as appearances by a young Ben Harper and Pixies. The venue was notorious for its lack of air-conditioning, making for sweltering gigs in summer. This was remediated under Chidgzey\u2019s ownership but, he said, it had broken down and there was no money for repairs. \u201cWe\u2019re going out as we started,\u201d he said. Plans are under way for farewell shows, as well as an auction of venue memorabilia.", "Queensland among worst violators of children\u2019s rights in youth justice system, research finds [2023-04-18T15:00:14Z]": " Queensland is among the worst offenders for violating children\u2019s rights in the youth justice system, with an ex-detainee claiming police treat young people \u201clike scum\u201d, according to new research. The report released by Save the Children on Wednesday found Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia have adopted \u201ctough on crime\u201d measures to youth justice instead of a \u201cchild\u2019s rights approach\u201d, which would be more effective and humane. In those three jurisdictions, the use of excessive force, restraint and adult facilities to detain children were identified as significant breaches of children\u2019s rights. Mat Tinkler, chief executive of Save the Children Australia, said Australia\u2019s youth justice system \u201cis responsible for repeated, egregious breaches of children\u2019s rights, often resulting in direct harm to many children\u201d.   Related: Queensland government to \u2018investigate\u2019 32-day detention of child, 13    \u201cWe are a nation that prides ourselves on giving everyone an opportunity to succeed, and yet authorities are setting children and young people up to fail,\u201d he said. Queensland overrode its Human Rights Act in February to make breach of bail an offence for children in light of \u201ccommunity concern\u201d after a series of high-profile crimes. Shane*, a former Queensland detainee, told Save the Children that police officers in watchhouses ignored requests for medical assistance and hit young people when cameras weren\u2019t switched on. \u201cSometimes [the police] can be all right, other times they just treat us like scum,\u201d he told the charity. \u201cThey like to swear at us, they like to hit us when the cameras are not on.\u201d Shane, 18, is on remand.

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The state\u2019s youth justice minister, Leanne Linard, said the bail changes \u201cwere not taken lightly\u201d and the government had \u201clistened to the community and acted in the interests of community safety\u201d.  In WA, boys have been sent to Casuarina prison, a maximum security facility for adults. Last year the state banned a dangerous restraint technique it had been using on children after criticism. \u201cUrgent attention\u201d is also needed in the NT, the report says. Critics have condemned laws passed in 2021 which automatically place children into police custody if they commit serious breaches of bail. Youth crime rates in Australia have steadily decreased over the past 10 years, but the majority of young people in the youth justice system have not been sentenced, the report says.   Related: Queensland passes controversial youth crime laws after heated human rights debate    Data shows almost half of the children in detention in 2020-21 were Indigenous despite representing just 6% of the population aged 10-17. Tinkler said governments \u201cmust invest in strengthening and expanding early intervention and diversion programs\u201d. \u201cThe punitive and \u2018tough on crime\u2019 approaches of Australian governments are the opposite of this,\u201d he said. The charity also wants the age of criminal responsibility to be increased from 10 to 14 years or older, independent oversight of youth detention facilities and limitations on solitary confinement and strip-searches on children. A spokesperson for the federal attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said the government was \u201cworking closely with state and territory governments on the issue of raising the minimum age of criminal responsibility\u201d.

Dr Omar Khorshid will warn that substantial funding is urgently needed to address the crisis in the country\u2019s hospitals. The message from the Australian Medical Association president comes after Albanese called him on Thursday morning in response to the association criticising Labor\u2019s $135m urgent care clinic policy, announced this week, as \u201cincoherent\u201d. Albanese was in the marginal seat of Hunter on Thursday, announcing that one of the 50 clinics would be built in Cessnock to take pressure off the local hospital\u2019s emergency department. Khorshid told Guardian Australia he expected to meet with Albanese and the party\u2019s shadow health minister, Mark Butler, in the coming days about the party\u2019s health platform. He said the association had not been so far consulted on any of Labor\u2019s proposed health policies. He said while the urgent care clinics might be popular with the public, they would not make any difference to the pressure on emergency departments. He added that he would be encouraging Labor to be more \u201ccourageous\u201d on the issue of health.   Related: Labor to commit $135m to trial 50 urgent care clinics intended to ease pressure on hospitals    In the lead-up to the election, both major parties have told the association they will not commit to the 5% boost to public hospital funding being demanded by states as they deal with a \u201clogjam\u201d of patients \u2013 leading to ambulance ramping, and patients unable to be admitted for treatment. This 5% funding boost, which would lift the commonwealth\u2019s share of public hospital funding to 50%, would cost about $5bn a year. \u201c50-50 hospital funding has not been accepted by either party as part of their platforms, and we\u2019ve pushed it hard with both and we\u2019ve had \u2018noes\u2019 from both so far,\u201d Khorshid told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe\u2019re not giving up just yet \u2013 which is why we\u2019re doing all this work, because we think it\u2019s a no-brainer, basically. And the states agree with us, so we\u2019ll keep pushing \u2026 But at this stage, we\u2019re not expecting it to be part of either party\u2019s announcements.\u201d Khorshid added that Labor had still not told the AMA what the party would be doing. \u201cBut I\u2019m pretty sure it won\u2019t include 50-50, unless we are amazingly successful in the next few days,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither party is interested.\u201d Khorshid said he would be asking Albanese \u2013 who has been pursuing a small target strategy, eschewing the multibillion policies Labor took to the last election \u2013 to \u201cstand for health\u201d. \u201cWe have not seen their vision for healthcare; we have seen a few small, piecemeal announcements,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that that will be a broad vision tackling the real problems, rather than a clinic here, a small thing there: marginal, seat-focused campaigns which might win elections, but won\u2019t fix the health system. \u201cIf [Albanese] can actually show that he stands for health, rather than spin and manipulating numbers and all this other stuff that the pollies normally do, [he needs to) actually stand up and say, \u2018We will pay for it and we will find a way to pay for it.\u2019\u201d Khorshid said that without the urgent injection of federal funds, which the AMA has said should be directed to increasing state hospital capacity, the crisis gripping Australia\u2019s hospitals will worsen. He warned this would be exacerbated by a surge in unmet demand for surgery which had been postponed as a result of the pandemic, as well as an ageing demographic. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a situation where you basically can\u2019t access low-urgency elective surgery in public hospitals. You\u2019ll just have to go private if you want a cataract or a hip replacement,\u201d Khorshid said.

We are going to see that more and more. \u201cI think it actually won\u2019t be allowed to deteriorate much more than it is at the moment because it\u2019ll just be untenable. How can you justify watching people die in emergency departments when you could do something about it? It\u2019s at your fingers, the solution. \u201cI think it\u2019ll just get so bad that eventually the crisis will create a response. But let\u2019s get in there now, because we\u2019ve got plenty of indicators and almost no disagreement.\u201d The call comes as ambulance ramping becomes an increasing problem for state governments, with the new South Australian Labor premier, Peter Malinauskas, winning the recent election largely on his commitment to fix the ramping crisis in the state. The Queensland government has also called for the federal government to commit to the 50-50 funding pledge. It is also under pressure about the growing issue of hospital ramping, with reports this week of 000 calls going unanswered. \u2022 The headline of this piece was changed on 16 April 2022 to reflect that the disappointment was the AMA\u2019s, rather than the health sector in general.", "Foreign relations: why an isolated Arizona man was arrested in connection to the Wieambilla shooting in Australia [2023-12-08T14:00:55Z]": "Donald Day Jr proudly sought to withdraw from the world and what he believed were its evils. In the remote backblocks of the US state of Arizona, he spoke of living off the grid, started a Facebook group for \u201cOutlaw Homesteads\u201d, and found himself isolated from members of his local community due to his beliefs and theories. In remote Queensland, Australian couple Gareth and Stacey Train, along with Gareth\u2019s brother, Nathaniel, were living similar lives on their own isolated block of land. Yet despite living half a world away from each other and eschewing much of modern society, the Trains and Day managed to connect. In Day\u2019s alleged words after their deaths, the couple were like family to him.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  How \u2013 and why \u2013 that happened is now being pieced together by law enforcement agencies in two countries, who have spent a year investigating Australia\u2019s first fundamentalist Christian terrorist attack. That investigation culminated in Day\u2019s arrest at a local petrol station, almost a year after he allegedly made threats of violence towards law enforcement.   Related: Wieambilla shooting arrest: Donald Day Jr\u2019s day of reckoning at an Arizona Dairy Queen    A grand jury indictment, charging him with two counts of making interstate threats, details the online links between Day and the Trains, who killed police officers Rachel McCrow and Matthew Arnold as well as a neighbour, Alan Dare, in Wieambilla, Queensland, before they themselves were gunned down. Posting under the username Geronimo\u2019s Bones, Day allegedly made a series of online comments and posts after the shootings, referring to the pseudonyms used by Gareth and Stacey Train. That allegedly included the threat that, \u201clike my brother Daniel, like my sister Jane , it is no different for us. The devils come for us, they fucking die.\u201d The indictment alleges the communication contained a \u201ctrue threat of violence\u201d and that the messages amounted to \u201ca threat to injure \u2026 any law enforcement official who comes to Day\u2019s residence\u201d. As news of Day\u2019s arrest spread through the community of Heber-Overgaard, locals shared stories of him. One said Day regularly bought pumpkins from her to feed his pigs; another claimed Day was a fan of his take-away barbecue. But what also emerged was a picture of a man whose increasing alienation with society drew him closer to those he met online who felt the same way. People like the Trains, the Wieambilla killers whose violence allegedly prompted some of Day\u2019s threats.    Day had animals on his remote property that he relied upon for food, just as the Trains had. Both the Trains and Day lived about 30km from the nearest town. Those towns, Tara and Heber-Overgaard, each have populations of less than 5000 \u2013 large enough to stock supplies that could last several weeks, but small enough that locals happen to notice outsiders. And both the Trains and Day appear to have become even more concerned about the fate of the world and isolated from others during the pandemic. Day is charged with not only threatening to kill law enforcement in the wake of the Wieambilla shootings, but for allegedly making threats in February against the director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Day told one person he met online that he only travelled into Heber-Overgaard about once a month. When he did, he liked to eat at June\u2019s Cafe, which, as the pandemic ravaged the US in 2020, posted a sign on the door warning people to \u201cENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK!\u201d \u201cEmployee\u2019s [sic] are MASK FREE, UNMUZZLED, BUT HAVE HAD ALL THEIR IMMUNIZATIONS!\u201d the sign read. Day suggested to this friend he met online that they catch up at June\u2019s for a coffee. The pair connected after Day posted a long message on the Heber-Overgaard community Facebook page. \u201cApart from my time out of country, I have resided in Arizona for most of my life. I have always been deeply in love with Arizona, for its natural beauty, its people, its culture and its quiet dignity,\u201d Day posted on 7 June. \u201cYet today, I do not recognize her, as she once was. Now, she has become a mere shadow of her former self- She has become a haven for drug addicts, child molesters, corrupt politicians, corporate policy enforcers, corporate parasites, odious drag queens and all manner of anti-american communists, whom all seek to utterly destroy her.\u201d The other man, who did not respond to a request for comment, replied to Day, \u201cAmen, u are preaching to the choir here ! The radical left is ruling and no one cares ! The latest is this WOKE crap !\u201d Day then wrote that he had failed to recruit others to his causes. \u201cI have tried on several occasions to raise the morale and the spirit of the local community, and have asked like-minded and right-minded folk to join in the fray against the political and corporate infection that has diseased the [Mogollon Rim region], yet at any council meeting I\u2019ve attended and spoke at, all that I encountered were the blank stares and glassy eyes of zombies,\u201d he said. A few weeks after this post, Day was removed as a member of the community Facebook page. Phillip Williams, the moderator of the page, told the Mountain Star he banned Day due to his antagonistic online behaviour. \u201cMy only communication was online with the community page, and he was a conspiracy theorist; he was [a] very scary kind of guy, but he had great literary skills,\u201d Williams said. It remains unclear why it had taken so long for Day to be charged with offences allegedly committed in February and last December.

Police are conducting an internal investigation into the death of the 30-year-old by suicide inside the Beenleigh police holding cells on Saturday. The incident has raised questions about the implementation of police procedures and checks, including whether the man should have been under constant observation.

Police did not respond to questions about how the man had been classified, or whether the classification by watch house staff was appropriate. However it is understood the investigation is looking at whether checks were adequate. The Courier-Mail reported this week that the investigation would look into how frequently the man was checked. Every prisoner \u2013 even in the lowest risk category \u2013 must be checked at least once an hour.

They want to build next door. We are not in a renewable energy zone but we are close to existing transmission lines. It is a traditional mixed agricultural area, with relatively safe rainfall by southern Australian standards. We are also classed as inner regional, close to population centres. In theory, we could grow food, energy or carbon.   Related: In Queensland\u2019s food bowl, farmers fear the gas bores from next door    One of the biggest issues that comes across my desk as a rural editor is the debate over changing land use. As with most rural issues, eventually it comes home. We are not alone. Across the country, communities are debating how best to plan for old and new land uses without much guidance or support from governments or the companies pursuing the new gold. Competing land claims range from food to mining precious metals to solar energy to wind turbines to carbon farming. Our stories about these issues \u2013 such as a windfarm in Nundle or a coal seam gas mine on the Liverpool Plains or the Darling Downs \u2013 are some of the most closely read and contested. The issue is not space. Australia is big. Farmers themselves need power so will be expanding their own power production. The issue is that everyone wants land close to existing infrastructure and populations to deliver food or energy at scale. While smart policy would accept that combined land use is the future, a key factor for farmers will be the potential returns per hectare. As Australian farmers have become some of the least trade protected in the world, the mighty dollar is the key determinant of survival in a dry climate. Will one hectare of food give a greater economic return than one hectare of solar panels or one hectare of carbon farming or one hectare of native habitat or biodiversity in the predicted \u201cgreen Wall Street\u201d markets? And how will this new use affect environmental assets such as ground and surface water, or infrastructure such as roads? These are the decisions farmers will be weighing up. The reality is, state and federal governments and Australians living in metropolitan areas are increasingly looking to regional landscapes to deliver affordable energy and greater emission reductions after more than a wasted decade of climate idiocy. At the same time, global corporations are hunting for carbon credits to offset business behaviours and production they don\u2019t want to change or have not changed fast enough.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  All of this must be done while increasing the volume and health benefits of the food already grown. Consumers are increasingly demanding cheap food produced with lower emissions, higher animal welfare standards and greater transparency. Australian food producers have been going like \u201cstabbed rats\u201d for the past three years to take advantage of higher commodity prices and three consecutive La Ni\u00f1as to grow more food. It was all very welcome, unless you were flooded out. Elsewhere, big trends continue to collide. There was a searing heatwave in Europe. Food inflation has been running rampant, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, higher input costs, higher labour costs, supply chain issues and in some cases increased supermarket profits.

Industry lobbyists and one of the biggest aged care providers in Australia believe the change would help address a funding crisis in residential aged care, improve conditions and boost staffing levels. The daily fees aged care facilities can charge are capped at $56.83, or $20,700 a year, for all Australians. This rate is fixed at 85% of the aged pension and adjusts to inflation twice a year.

Maskell-Knight said transparency had improved since the royal commission but cited two ongoing issues in the sector obscuring what government funds and resident fees were used for: a lack of financial disclosure by providers and payments to related parties. Maskell-Knight said the royal commission exposed a large number of related party transactions, where money from aged care providers was transferred to beneficial operators or affiliated companies and could then be used for purposes other than aged care. \u201cSignificant amounts of money were funnelled to the beneficial owner of the aged care provider, which meant it was very difficult to get a clear view of what the provider\u2019s true financial state was,\u201d Maskell-Knight said.

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Under the recently introduced Australian National Aged Care Classification funding model, subsidies paid to providers are determined by the care needs of each resident. Residents are independently placed into one of 13 categories depending on the level of care they require, and those who require more care generate larger subsidies. From October these subsidies will help providers deliver mandated care minutes for each resident. The minutes vary for each category of residents. Mirus has warned providers that reclassifying residents to reflect their deteriorating health may not always make business sense because increased subsidies won\u2019t always cover the increased cost of mandated care. The company used the example of reclassifying a resident from class seven to nine, which would move them from assisted-mobility to a non-mobile category. This would increase the government subsidy by $10 a day and require an extra 11 minutes of care be provided. A registered nurse would need to provide seven of those minutes. \u201cThe cost to the business to meet that new level of care that we are mandated to [provide] means that ultimately we are moving backwards in our sustainability,\u201d the company told providers in a video briefing. According to the analysis, a resident who is immobile and could be in respite care is the least profitable. \u201cFunding of Australia\u2019s aged care system is complex, confusing for many, and can lead to poor resident outcomes for those who don\u2019t understand how it works,\u201d a Mirus Australia spokesperson said. \u201cFunding varies according to need.\u201d The spokesperson added: \u201cThis helps explain why more than 1,000 aged care professionals recently attended our training courses, including representatives of the Independent Health and Aged Care Pricing Authority, the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care and the Department of Health.\u201d \u2018The government needs to take action\u2019 Bryan Keon-Cohen, a retired barrister and founder of Aged Care Justice, a not-for-profit that assists families access legal representation, called on the federal government to investigate the Mirus modelling. \u201cWhen a funding model creates disproportionate outcomes for aged care facilities by financially incentivising the admission of residents with less complex care needs than others, we are not putting the person first,\u201d Keon-Cohen said. \u201cAustralia needs a sustainable person-centred model to ensure that the aged care sector is supported to deliver quality care to every resident, regardless of their subsidy classification. \u201cNow that Mirus has identified the problem, the government needs to take action to ensure that the system works for all.\u201d Prof Kathy Eagar, who helped design the government\u2019s funding model and is a former adviser to the aged care royal commission, said the new system made it harder for providers to \u201cmanipulate the assessment system to maximise income\u201d.

But she wrote that the deals were necessary to ensure that critical support services for vulnerable children were not compromised. \u201cWithout [physical and sexual abuse] coverage many child protection and youth homelessness service providers would be exposed to uninsured claims,\u201d Linard replied. \u201cIf claims are made that providers are unable to meet they may be forced to shut down, which would severely affect service delivery to vulnerable children and families.\u201d The chief executive of Beyond Abuse, Steve Fisher, a survivor of child abuse, was shocked by the indemnity arrangements, questioning how church groups could claim they were unable to pay, given their extensive assets and global wealth. \u201cIf they can\u2019t get insurance, that\u2019s their problem,\u201d he said. \u201cUse some of the hundreds of millions that they\u2019ve got in the bank to pay these claims. \u201cIt sounds like they\u2019re basically holding the government to ransom by saying if you don\u2019t do it, then we\u2019ll have to close down.\u201d Kezelman said she was concerned by the secretive nature of the indemnity deals. \u201cThe royal commission showed us repeatedly the cost of secrecy and lack of transparency, as the harm inflicted was perpetrated in the dark,\u201d she said. The revelation follows reports in the Australian that the Catholic church\u2019s insurer may be forced to wind down its own operations unless bailed out by its members to cover the cost of sexual abuse cases. \u2022 In Australia, children, young adults, parents and teachers can contact the Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800, or Bravehearts on 1800 272 831, and adult survivors can contact Blue Knot Foundation on 1300 657 380.

The health minister, Mark Butler, announced the measure on Monday in a round of interviews defending the decision to reimpose pre-flight Covid testing for passengers from China as necessary because of a \u201cabsence of comprehensive information\u201d about the disease in China. The announcement on Sunday has already prompted calls to expand pre-flight testing, with the independent MP Monique Ryan questioning if it was now \u201ctime to require pre-travel testing of all travellers entering Australia from Europe, the US, Africa and Asia\u201d.   Related: Australia imposes mandatory Covid tests for travellers from China amid fears of diplomatic backlash    On Monday Butler told Radio National there is \u201cno evidence right now\u201d of new emerging variants in China and that \u201cthe evidence does suggest that the main driver of this very large wave in China is a variant of Omicron\u201d, the dominant strain in Australia and around the world for the last 12 months. \u201cIt\u2019s a variant called BF.7 which is a derivative of the BA.5 variant of Omicron which has been the main driver of Covid cases in Australia for the last 6 or 7 months, he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a variant that we\u2019re familiar with that has been in Australia for several months \u2013 BF.7 \u2013 and, as I said, there\u2019s a broad consensus there\u2019s no imminent public health threat.\u201d  Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads  Butler said Australia had imposed pre-flight testing for travellers from China \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d due to \u201cwhat the World Health Organization pointed to [as a] lack of information that would allow us to identify very quickly the emergence of that new variant\u201d. \u201cWhat we\u2019ll be doing is looking to introduce wastewater testing from aeroplanes that land in Australia. That\u2019s an Australian innovation that\u2019s been picked up by America and some other countries. \u201cThat again gives us a good line of sight, if there are Covid cases coming into Australia, what the variants are \u2026 and very early information about the possibility of a new variant emerging as well.\u201d In October 2021 the Australian science agency CSIRO released a study with Qantas and the University of Queensland showing that wastewater testing can be an effective way to screen incoming passengers for Covid-19. In the last week, the US Centre for Disease Control and the UK both announced they are considering use of wastewater testing. Australia\u2019s mandatory testing within 48 hours of departure will apply to travellers from Hong Kong and Macau, in addition to those from mainland China, and is set to begin on Thursday. But on Monday, Butler could not say whether travellers will be required to take a PCR test or if they can use the quicker, more accessible rapid antigen tests. \u201cThose details are being finalised, right now, they\u2019ll be published very shortly, including on the Smartraveller website\u201d The agriculture minister, Murray Watt, told 4BC Radio if travellers tested positive pre-flight \u201cthen of course we\u2019re asking them not to get on the plane, and we\u2019re asking airlines to play a role in preventing that from happening\u201d. \u201cBut for people who were to contract covid on the plane, we\u2019d be asking them to stay at home, isolate, test, and be considerate of other people,\u201d he said, ruling out \u201canything like \u2026 hotel quarantine or mandatory isolation days\u201d. Earlier, Butler told ABC News Breakfast that a ban on travel from China is \u201cnot on our table right now\u201d because Australia wants to see resumption of travel. Butler told Channel Seven\u2019s Sunrise that Australia\u2019s decision for testing \u201creflects decisions that have been taken across the world by countries in North America, in Europe and across Asia\u201d.

The end of China\u2019s zero-Covid approach comes as case numbers surge, with low vaccination rates especially among elderly people. Ascertaining the spread and severity of Covid is more difficult than ever as Beijing has stopped publishing daily case numbers and ended mass testing. \u201cThey\u2019ve changed very quickly from a zero-Covid approach to completely relaxing things, so maybe that\u2019s happened too quickly to keep up,\u201d said Dwyer, who was one of the experts tasked with travelling to Wuhan early in 2021 to investigate the origins of the pandemic in a report for the WHO.", "Failure to protect nature is a bigger threat to humanity than inflation, Australian scientists warn [2023-05-12T15:00:57Z]": "Leading Australian scientists have accused the Albanese government of offering \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d funding to stop environmental decline, and warned that failing to protect nature would lead to \u201can existential threat greater than inflation\u201d. The Biodiversity Council, an independent research hub, said the limited funding for environment programs announced this week suggested that environment minister Tanya Plibersek\u2019s promised target of ending species extinctions in the country was \u201cstill hollow\u201d. The council applauded the government\u2019s promise of $121m over four years to create a natural Environment Protection Agency, but said the budget failed to provide the funding boost needed to protect and recover threatened species and ecosystems.   Related: Albanese government approves first new coalmine since taking power    A five-year government review released last year found the health of Australia\u2019s environment was poor and deteriorating, in part due to a lack of funding. Launching the state of the environment report, Plibersek said the environment would be \u201cback on the priority list\u201d under Labor after funding cuts and neglect under the Coalition. Prof Hugh Possingham, a co-chief councillor at the Biodiversity Council and Queensland\u2019s former chief scientist, said it was too early to judge the government\u2019s performance, but urgent action was needed. He said it would have major consequences for the economy, human health, agriculture and clean air and water if the country continued to run down its natural capital. \u201cUnderfunding the care of the environment is an existential threat far greater than inflation,\u201d he said. Possingham said the environment was important for people\u2019s health and wellbeing and about half of Australia\u2019s gross domestic product relied on natural systems. An assessment of 40,000 datasets had found Australia\u2019s threatened species had been declining at a rate of about 2% a year since the turn of the millennium.

If the Sydney Opera House had been disappearing at 2% a year, what would we think?\u201d he said. \u201cThere seems to be this disconnect between what we tolerate for economic and social outcomes and what we tolerate for nature.\u201d Australia has about 1,900 species and ecosystems that are listed as threatened. Peer-reviewed studies have found 19 ecosystems are showing signs of collapse. Prof Brendan Wintle, an ecologist at the University of Melbourne and a Biodiversity Council member, estimated the country needed to boost spending on environment programs by about six times to prevent extinctions and halt other declines. \u201cFor just 10% of the stage-three tax cuts we could recover every one of Australia\u2019s almost 2,000 threatened species,\u201d he said. The environment budget included $262m for degraded national parks, $163m for the Australian Institute of Marine Science and $45m to restore important sites in Sydney Harbour. In response to the scientists, Plibersek said the government was investing a record amount into the environment, including $224.5m for a saving native species program and $231.5m to establish 10 new Indigenous protected areas.   Related: Households offered $1bn help in budget to install energy saving measures     \u201cAnd this budget includes almost $440m of new money through the Natural Heritage Trust for programs to conserve threatened species and ecosystems and restore Ramsar wetlands,\u201d she said. Plibersek said protecting threatened species required action across government, including rewriting environmental laws and the introduction of an EPA and Environment Information Australia, a separate new body promised to improve knowledge about threatened species. Legislation has been promised later this year. The chief conservation officer with World Wildlife Fund Australia, Rachel Lowry, said those commitments were welcome but in reality there appeared to be little-to-no new money for on-ground conservation compared with previous budgets. She said the government had renewed the existing Natural Heritage Trust program, which did not increase the overall pool of funding and the national parks funding was a \u201ctrifling\u201d amount spread over four years and mostly earmarked for infrastructure upgrades. \u201cThere is nothing new for critical on-the-ground conservation efforts and certainly not the major increase that is needed to halt and reverse rapid biodiversity loss,\u201d Lowry said. First coalmine approval Plibersek drew criticism after indicating a new coalmine would receive federal approval for the first time since the Albanese government was elected a year ago. The proposed Isaac River mine development in central Queensland is relatively small, expected to yield up to 500,000 tonnes of coal a year for up to five years. It would produce metallurgical coal, used in steel-making, which is considered harder to immediately replace with clean alternatives than thermal coal, used in electricity generation.

Chalmers was an ANU alumnus, completing a PhD on the leadership of Paul Keating. Back then, he worked as a researcher in Labor\u2019s national secretariat and had just wound up work on a party review spearheaded by Bob Hawke and Neville Wran. He went to the pub. A few beverages in, someone mentioned Hawke had swum the length of the University House fish pond half a century before. Fortified by brash laddishness, history and beer, Chalmers waded in and performed a re-enactment. Twenty years later, Chalmers returned to the ANU as the federal treasurer and shared this anecdote with a group of elite scholars. Youthful hijinks were repackaged as a story with a moral. Chalmers told the group it was great to mirror your heroes, but people who wanted to make the world a better place needed to offer more than homage or mimicry. They needed to \u201cwalk further, and forward\u201d \u2013 a theme he\u2019s played with since his first speech to parliament. Michael Cooney, a close friend since their ANU post-grad days, says Australia\u2019s treasurer is one of the few people of his acquaintance with the brio to dive into a fishpond in the dead of Canberra\u2019s winter \u201cand the poise to make such good use of it\u201d.   Related: The Coalition scoffed at the idea of a wellbeing budget. But Australians want Jim Chalmers to deliver | Rebecca Huntley    On Tuesday, Chalmers will have his chance to walk further and forward, defining himself, defining the new government, when he delivers the Albanese government\u2019s first budget. It\u2019s a big moment for a new treasurer only five months into the portfolio. Nerves would be understandable. But he\u2019s a veteran of the ritual. Chalmers has staffed 16 budgets as a backroom adviser in opposition and in government. In the parliamentary parlance, this makes him the father of the Canberra lock-up. Chalmers has known the secretary of Treasury, Steven Kennedy, for 15 years. His chief of staff, Claudia Crawford, worked with him when they both worked for Wayne Swan, the Labor treasurer who piloted Australia through the global financial crisis. He understands the bureaucracy and the regulators. The econocrats and their rituals are as familiar and comforting as a pair of old socks. Katy Gallagher, the finance minister, is a friend as well as a colleague. Gallagher is regarded by many cabinet colleagues as the EQ of the Albanese government. The treasurer says preparing a budget with her is like being \u201chit in the arse with a rainbow\u201d.    Given his political apprenticeship, much about being treasurer feels very familiar. But Chalmers is making two transitions. The first is from the backroom to front of house. The second is opposition to government.  Chalmers advised Swan during the global financial crisis. In opposition, he helped craft pre-election policy during a global health emergency that became a supply shock. In government, he\u2019s assembling his first budget in the middle of a global inflation shock, with rising interest rates and the potential for major economies to tip into recession. While market analysts scan the horizon for a hard landing, flood waters in eastern Australia continue to rise, inundating crops and property, creating a new round of supply shortages and inflationary pressure. The treasurer spent the Rudd-Gillard years as a private actor, often in the rooms where it happened, never on the news. This backstory makes him both a veteran and a fresh, next-generation figure; as one colleague puts it, Chalmers is the class captain of the parliamentary intake of 2013. The class of 2013 included a number of former senior staffers, freed hostages, decoupled from the feuds and intrigues of their mentors. The unofficial motto of this cohort is never forget, never repeat.   Related: Australia\u2019s economic outlook to be downgraded in budget amid global \u2018deterioration\u2019    When we speak this week, I ask Chalmers to tell me what he\u2019s learned from his privileged vantage point. He says three things. If you want to stay in government, you need to do big things slowly and little things quickly. Pacing always matters. Unity matters. If there\u2019s \u201cnot a collective coherence to the cabinet then you compromise your achievements\u201d. And the third is a lesson about time. It takes an eternity to win government, and you can be past-tense in the blink of an eye. \u201cYou wake up one day and it\u2019s finished, it\u2019s over. It goes so quickly.\u201d Promises, problems and puzzles Chalmers hails from Logan City, south of Brisbane. He lives 900 metres from where he grew up. Logan is classic struggle street. The treasurer\u2019s constituents in the seat of Rankin live on the frontline of the current inflation shock and they won\u2019t benefit from stage-three tax cuts costing the budget $254bn over 10 years. Tuesday\u2019s budget will also see the end of the low- and middle-income tax offset, a tax break worth up to $1,080 a year. The treasurer\u2019s mother is a nurse who worked night shift. His father, a courier driver, left the marriage when Chalmers was 13. He has two older sisters but was home alone at night for most of his adolescence. He says he was a badly behaved kid who could have spiralled. A high school history teacher found a way to reach him and give him a sense of purpose. Chalmers tracked towards politics through university, culminating in the doctoral thesis at ANU. He worked in the Queensland bureaucracy, then Labor politics, with the organisational wing the entry point.    Chalmers met Anthony Albanese in the same year he staged the Hawke homage in the University House fish pond \u2013 2002 \u2013 when he worked in Labor\u2019s national secretariat with Tim Gartrell, then an ALP assistant national secretary, now Albanese\u2019s chief of staff. At their first meeting, Albanese was in a tracksuit. Gartrell was helping him move apartments. The two struck up an easy friendship. Albanese was close to Swan and used to visit the office frequently during the long nights of Rudd-Gillard. Often, Albanese would have a nightcap with Chalmers. The prime minister and the treasurer share a March birthday, although there\u2019s a 15-year age gap. This relationship survived the complexities of the Rudd-Gillard civil war, but was tested after the 2019 election. After Bill Shorten lost, Albanese hoped to take the party leadership unopposed given he had support from the overwhelming majority of the left faction and from chunks of the right. But Chalmers was encouraged to run. A next-generation rightwinger from Queensland as federal leader was considered a smart response in some quarters of the party to the devastating election result, and Chalmers gave stepping up serious thought. But ultimately, Albanese got his wish. He would lead by acclamation. Chalmers would be shadow treasurer. Wanting the same prize frayed their relationship. Things have turned a corner, but it took time, patience and demonstrations of goodwill to restore equilibrium. Maintaining that equilibrium will be critical to the success of the new government. It is possible for prime ministers and treasurers to be too close. Josh Frydenberg, who bunked in with Scott Morrison at the Lodge during the pandemic, and was bundled out of parliament in May in a visceral, anti-Morrison swing, could perhaps shed some light on the perils of proximity. But avoiding poison in the relationship is also critical. Governments work best when prime ministers and treasurers trust one another and pursue common objectives. Right now, the first Albanese-Chalmers budget has to deliver election promises and set signposts to the future. But the challenges the new government faces are already crowding in and things will get harder as time passes. The global economy is volatile. The budget is in structural deficit, and spending on important social services and defence is baked in and rising. So is the interest bill on the accumulated debt. The budget has a revenue problem, and Labor just won an election by shedding the controversial revenue measures voters rejected in 2019.    There is an obvious tension between maintaining election promises and doing what needs to be done. With Albanese\u2019s endorsement, Chalmers recently began making the case for winding back the fiscally irresponsible stage-three tax cuts that Labor promised to keep in the run-up to the May election. But that particular conundrum won\u2019t be resolved in next week\u2019s budget. Having lost elections in the past because of perceptions of scary taxes and broken promises, there is collective paranoia about not repeating past mistakes. I wonder if Chalmers thinks Labor needs an explicit mandate at another election to bring the budget back in order. The answer is clearly no. \u201cI don\u2019t think our major budget challenges can wait years down the track,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it would be strange to identify pressing structural spending pressures and say we can\u2019t deal with them for four or five years.\u201d   Interactive   The treasurer wants next Tuesday to be the start of a conversation that will span four budgets. \u201cI\u2019ve got three little kids at home,\u201d Chalmers says. \u201cWe do a lot of jigsaw puzzles. When you tip the box out and you\u2019ve got 100 pieces or 500 pieces and you\u2019ve got all this jumble, what do you tell your kids? You tell them to start with the corners. The corners are inflation, another corner is the wasted decade \u2013 skills shortages, an energy crisis, an aged care crisis, wage stagnation. Another corner is floods. How are we going to fund the support people need and deserve? \u201cYou start with the corners, with the edges, and you fill it in. We might have four budgets this term. Three, maybe four. I\u2019ve tried to think about this journey not as a budget every now and again, but three or four budgets that we colour in over time.\u201d    I think people are sick of the schmaltz and the fakeness of economic commentary. They want something real, even if it\u2019s a bit spiky  Jim Chalmers     I wonder whether or not the journey from the corners of the jigsaw to the centre requires some kind of structure or scaffold. Something like the Henry tax review that was convened by the Rudd government after the \u201cAustralia 2020\u201d summit in 2008. Does a conversation like this need an event to give it both momentum and a focal point? Chalmers can\u2019t be definitive on that point because a decision like that is always collective. But the treasurer\u2019s predisposition is clear. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rule out some form of formality [like a review] but it\u2019s not my inclination. I feel like there is a structure around the current conversation and that\u2019s a bit different to the immediate aftermath of the 2020 summit. \u201cI do want to engage people, engage experts, have a structured conversation, but I haven\u2019t instinctively reached for a review headed by a person or a panel because I feel like people broadly understand the issues.\u201d    Walking further, and forward Chalmers says Keating remains the gold standard in political communication about the economy. \u201cWhat he did best was include people in a conversation about the economy and talk up to them rather than down to them,\u201d Chalmers says. \u201cI think about that almost every day. How do I take the complexity of the economy and the budget and not dumb it down but explain it and level with people about what we are grappling with; try and give them the sense that there\u2019s a lot of 50-50 calls in managing the economy. That\u2019s the sense I want to give.\u201d   Related: Jim Chalmers says cost of stage-three tax cuts has blown out to $254bn over 10 years    He acknowledges he\u2019s learning on the job. \u201cI don\u2019t always do that eloquently or elegantly. You are always trying to find a balance but I really try and talk up to people rather down to people and one of the main reasons I\u2019m trying to be different to my immediate predecessor is I think people are sick of the schmaltz and the fakeness of economic commentary. They want something real, even if it\u2019s a bit spiky.\u201d Real and spiky is the unavoidable fact that the budget needs more revenue. Despite the enormous pent-up need in Australia after a decade of policy drift, the times also call for expenditure restraint, both to subdue inflation and rebuild the fiscal buffers in the event of a new global downturn. Chalmers will unveil a temporary windfall on Tuesday. Tax receipts will be revised up by more than $100bn over the forward estimates, but that bonanza will quickly wash through. One key test of policy seriousness on Tuesday night will be how much of that windfall Labor spends.    Looking ahead, the treasurer says the response to the challenges of our times will require different strategies than the ones Hawke and Keating deployed in the 1980s to transform Australia\u2019s economy and set the country up for decades of economic expansion. Doing what needs to be done will involve Albanese and Chalmers walking further, and forward. This week I ask Chalmers to define what that means for him.

He understands the political stakes. In 2025, voters will judge Labor\u2019s performance on its merits, and the mark will be pass or fail. \u201cThere is pressure,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I feel that pressure every day.\u201d", "Government urged to reject plan to release CSG wastewater near \u2018bum-breathing\u2019 turtle\u2019s Queensland habitat [2022-10-11T16:30:09Z]": "Campaigners are calling on the federal government to stop Santos from releasing untreated coal seam gas wastewater into a Queensland river that provides critical habitat to two species of threatened \u201cbum-breathing\u201d turtles. The oil and gas company has approval to dig an additional 6,100 gas wells near Roma, in the state\u2019s south west. But the federal government ruled last year that the plan to pump resulting wastewater into the Dawson River must be assessed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, due to the \u201cunacceptable\u201d risk it could pose to the critically endangered, white-throated snapping turtle and the Fitzroy River turtle, which is listed as vulnerable. Under its Fairview Water Release Scheme, Santos could release 18 megalitres of \u201creverse osmosis treated\u201d CSG wastewater into the Dawson every day, as well as an unspecified amount of untreated wastewater during times of heavy flow, which could be up to 52 times a year. A report by the Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development (IESC), handed to the government in July, found that the release of untreated water could have \u201cmajor impacts\u201d upon about 12km of the Dawson River currently untouched by water releases, including directly and indirectly exposing the turtles to contaminants.

The committee also found that the regular release of treated water could have a range of negative effects on the river, creating conditions that favour invasive species and further disadvantage the already stressed turtles.

She said the \u201cbum-breathing\u201d turtles were species that practice cloacal respiration, a unique form of breathing that means the turtles, particularly juveniles, were extremely susceptible to changes in water quality. \u201cThe recent state of the environment report showed the devastating decline of our native wildlife numbers and their habitat. This is an opportunity to put threatened species first,\u201d Smith said.

The company\u2019s Galilee Coal project, in the Galilee Basin, wants to mine 4om tonnes of coal a year, making it Australia\u2019s biggest thermal coalmine. But in November the president of the Queensland land court, Fleur Kingham, said the emissions from the burning of the coal would, through its effects on global heating, limit the human and cultural rights of First Nations people and young Queenslanders.

And the recovery from Covid-19 may have narrowed the demographic even further, according to the joint study led by Deakin University. Of the 184 Australian cultural organisations surveyed, and 1,011 individual responses from those working within arts organisations, more than half the respondents conceded they had made little or no changes to their programming or outreach programs to attract audiences from different cultures, age groups, geographic locations and gender identities.   Related: Young Australians now the least likely to attend arts events as cost of living bites    In general, arts festivals, museums and galleries, opera companies and orchestras appeared the most resistant to identifying new target audiences and adjusting programming to attract them. The study did not identify which specific organisations. The Sydney Opera House, Australia\u2019s flagship state theatre and dance companies, arts festivals and a range of state and national museums and galleries, along with many smaller regional organisations, were captured in the research. Led by the Deakin University professor of arts and cultural management, Hilary Glow, the research concluded that when it came to programming performances and exhibitions with the potential to capture new audiences, 55% of organisations fell into the \u201cavoider\u201d category \u2013 that is, ignoring or resisting change and prioritising their existing audiences to the exclusion of other potential audiences.  Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning  Glow said while most organisations recognised the need to broaden their audience base to capture more diverse populations, for many it was a case of \u201ctalking the talk but not walking the walk\u201d. \u201cThey are internally focused conversations,\u201d Glow said. \u201cIf an organisation is really going to take audience diversity seriously, they\u2019re going to have to stop having fascinating conversations in their boardrooms and start bringing an external focus into the organisation.\u201d A recent trawl of major arts organisation boards conducted by the Guardian found that although gender parity was evident across most, the more traditional art forms such as opera and orchestras still had boards made up overwhelmingly of white men. A number of flagship organisations have, however, set up First Nations advisory boards, including the National Gallery of Australia, Queensland Art Gallery and Gallery of Modern Art, and the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Earlier this year the Melbourne Theatre Company became the first major performing arts organisation to form a dedicated a group of artists diverse in culture and age to act as an advisory council to those making the programming decisions. \u201cOne of the tasks that organisations absolutely have to commit to, if they\u2019re going to diversify their audiences, is to diversify their workforce,\u201d Glowsaid. \u201cPositions across an arts organisation need to be diverse themselves. But that is not the only thing that needs to happen. There\u2019s no evidence to suggest that by simply putting someone from a minority or diverse background in any kind of leadership position it\u2019s instantly going to lead to new audiences.\u201d Glow said there was evidence that \u201cavoider\u201d behaviour towards diversifying audiences was more noticeable in organisations dependent on a loyal subscriber base, bases that were severely eroded with the onset of the pandemic in 2020. \u201cWhat happens is that an organisation ends up knowing an awful lot about the demographics of the people who buy their subscription passes. They have a high level of knowledge about their existing audiences but this doesn\u2019t help them understand who isn\u2019t there. \u201cI think many organisations have set themselves up to nurture their existing audiences, possibly at the expense of thinking about investing in the pursuit of new audiences, new knowledge, new ideas and new programming.\u201d Glow said it was hard to ignore the role Covid has played in entrenched patterns of behaviour and risk-averse programming. \u201cPost-Covid, many organisations treated that as an opportunity to further build and strengthen their relationships with their current audiences,\u201d she said. Academics from Edith Cowan University and the UK\u2019s University of Sheffield, and the Australia Council Board member and theatre and festival director Wesley Enoch, also contributed to the research. The second phase of the project will see 11 selected organisations, including the Sydney Opera House, the Sydney Theatre Company, Melbourne\u2019s Rising festival and the Adelaide Festival Centre, work with a panel of change experts to develop a range of resources to attract new audiences.", "Afternoon Update: Australia to get a poet laureate; US police allegedly beat homeless man; and a smart immigration interactive [2023-01-30T05:26:36Z]": "Australia will have its own poet laureate \u2013 an honorary position the UK has had since the 17th century \u2013 under a major arts overhaul announced by the federal government. \u201cThis is our soul.

As they were notoriously shy and skittish towards humans, often the closest he\u2019d get would be discovering faint traces of their paw prints in the sand near his campsite. By the next day, the wind would blow the tracks away, as if the animals were never really there to begin with. \u201cI\u2019ve been going [to K\u2019gari] since I was a one-year-old, and you almost never saw a dingo at all,\u201d Sinclair, now 53, says.     A few hours north of Brisbane, K\u2019gari, the world\u2019s largest sand island, remains an extraordinarily successful tourism destination, hosting hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. In June, the island was stripped of its colonial name, Fraser Island, and restored to K\u2019gari, which means \u2018paradise\u2019 in the local Butchulla language. It\u2019s a fitting name for a stunning island that\u2019s home to spectacular sand blows, freshwater lakes and towering eucalyptus forests.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  For thousands of years, the Butchulla people coexisted with dingoes, which were brought over to K\u2019gari by Asian fishers. The \u201cwat\u2019dha\u201d or camp dingo were Butchulla companions, helping them hunt and protecting them from bad spirits. The \u201cwongari\u201d were wild dingoes that roamed the sweeping coastline hunting for wallabies, lizards and rodents. When the last Indigenous people were removed from the island, all the dingoes became wild.     But a string of recent dingo attacks has rangers worried the animals are no longer scared of humans and that tourist behaviour is causing escalations in their aggression. One particularly \u201chigh-risk\u201d animal was killed by injection on Wednesday after an attack on a 24-year-old woman who was hospitalised after being mauled by four dingoes while jogging down the beach.  Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads  The dingo had also been \u201cresponsible\u201d for four \u201cvery severe\u201d attacks, including one on a child this year, according to principal ranger, Danielle Mansfield.   Related: K\u2019gari dingo euthanised after pack attack that left young woman in hospital    A department of environment spokesperson said the dingo that was put down weighed 17 kilograms, \u201cwhich is heavy for a dingo and indicated it had been fed\u201d. \u201cIt was also clear from its behaviour that it had become habituated, either by being fed or from people interacting with it for videos and selfies.\u201d \u2018In the past they\u2019d never approach you\u2019 Sinclair\u2019s father, John, was a renowned local campaigner who spent decades on the successful fight to end sand mining and logging on the island before his death in 2019. Sinclair estimates he\u2019s visited the island hundreds of times and says he first detected a shift in dingo behaviour in the mid-90s. \u201cI was sitting on the beach observing one of the lakes, and a dingo came and walked around my picnic blanket. It was stalking me. It was quite disturbing,\u201d he said.    \u201cWe went for a swim and then it came down and just pulled the lid off the esky and grabbed some things and ran away.\u201d This year, a dingo ran towards Sinclair and his wife while they were taking photos of birds on the beach. \u201cIn the past, they\u2019d never approach you. But it\u2019s ridiculous the number of times I\u2019ve seen humans hand-feeding dingoes,\u201d he says. Nobody knows for sure exactly why attacks are becoming more frequent, but almost everyone Guardian Australia spoke to believes it is linked to the growth in tourism on the island. This week, two women were fined $2,300 each for taking selfies with the animals in a blatant breach of \u201cdingo safety\u201d protocol repeated at length in signage and brochures available to tourists on the island. Visitors are told never to walk alone, leave children unattended or go running. It\u2019s an offence to feed or intentionally attract or disturb the dingoes whose presence creates the authentic Australian experience many tourists seek.   Related: Child in Queensland hospital after \u2018terrifying\u2019 dingo attack near camping ground on K\u2019gari     Animal behaviourist Bradley Smith blames visitors in search of the perfect social media shot for changes in the animals\u2019 behaviour. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a dingo problem on the island, we have a people problem,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you want to go for a run on the beach, go to the Gold Coast. If you go to Africa or the Rocky Mountains, you respect the fact that you\u2019re around wildlife that can kill you.\u201d Smith says people are ignorant to the danger of dingoes because they are small and puppy-like, prompting tourists to give them a \u201ccheeky bit of fruit\u201d to get a great photo.    \u201cThat might be a benign incident for you, but that\u2019s setting the scene for the future. It\u2019s like a death sentence for a dingo when you start feeding.\u201d Sinclair agrees. \u201cI hear people say all the time \u2018but I want to feed them because they\u2019re so skinny\u2019 \u2026 but dingoes are a naturally lean animal,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could literally feed them a lot of food and in a day they\u2019d be skinny again, like a greyhound.\u201d Sinclair believes there should be further enforcement of fines, and potentially a one- or two-strike rule implemented to exclude problem visitors from the island. K\u2019gari attracts two distinct types of tourists: those who head to the resorts and go on organised tours, and independent campers who relish the opportunity to take a four-wheel drive on the wide open sands. Since the pandemic, senior ranger Linda Behrendorff says she\u2019s seeing worsening behaviour from people who\u2019ve recently joined the latter group.    They\u2019ve recently bought their first four-wheel-drive and they\u2019re hitting nature reserves all across Queensland, often with too much alcohol, she says. And they won\u2019t be told the rules.  \u201cI\u2019ve actually booked someone for feeding once. Ticket in their hand, they looked me fair in the eye and went: \u2018It was worth it\u2019. \u201cWhat do you do with that? They paid for the experience that they wanted with a wild dingo at the expense of that dingo. Arrogance.\u201d Butchulla woman and community engagement officer Tessa Waia says locals were \u201cin tears\u201d at the loss of a dingo this week.   Related: Research suggests that more than half of Australia\u2019s dingoes are genetically pure, not hybrids    \u201cThe Butchulla have been very generous [in] sharing their country with people that are respectful. It\u2019s so disrespectful \u2013 those that do not want to heed the requests [of the people] that own and manage the country for the benefit of the next generations.\u201d \u2018We need the dingoes\u2019 After a deadly attack on a nine-year-old in 2001, the Queensland government ordered a cull of the animals, wiping out 20 or so dingoes at random across the island. It is estimated fewer than 200 remain. A spate of dingo attacks in 2019 saw the state roll out higher fines, and in 2021 a $2m fence stretching 7km was erected around the Orchid Beach township. Fencing is also in place around the Happy Valley and Eurong townships, as well as major camping spots. In response to questions about a repeat cull this week, the state government was resolute: it was not an option. In the past two months they\u2019ve euthanised two dingoes, the first since 2019.   Related: K\u2019gari dingo attack: calls for a cull rejected after injured woman fled into ocean to escape pack    Mansfield told reporters: \u201cWe\u2019re not in the business of destroying animals. We\u2019re in the business of conserving wildlife and looking after their habitat.\u201d Fraser Coast mayor, George Seymour, points out those two destroyed animals represent at least 1% of the island\u2019s dingoes, gone for ever. Their future viability depends on keeping a healthy population. Seymour says nobody locally has called for a cull, with residents aware of the small dingo population\u2019s unbroken heritage. \u201cThat population is a national treasure and needs to be protected and preserved. The greatest risk to it is human habituation,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re much more likely to be in a car accident, \u2026 eaten by a shark, [and] to drown than be attacked by a dingo.\u201d Cheryl Bryant from Save Fraser Island Dingoes says the government should consider capping tourist numbers during peak holiday periods to keep both dingoes and tourists safe. \u201cThe island, the east coast, gets saturated with tourists. It\u2019s impossible for the dingoes living in that area to avoid people,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need the dingoes \u2026 If it comes down to it, they\u2019re more important than the tourists.\u201d As authorities continue to search for ways to ensure dingoes and tourists can coexist safely, Sinclair is reminded of the day of his dad\u2019s greatest victory.  \u201cWhen World Heritage [status] was appointed, I said to dad: \u2018We\u2019ve won, the island is going to be saved.\u2019 \u201cHe said: \u2018Nope, now we\u2019ve got to save it from being loved to death\u2019.\u201d", "\u2018Abysmal\u2019 number of Australian banks and super funds have policies to mitigate environmental risks: report [2022-12-12T14:00:03Z]": "Australia\u2019s major banks and superannuation funds are failing to properly assess the damage their investments and financial decisions do to nature or set targets to reverse that damage, according to new analysis.

While destruction of nature was considered an issue that needed their attention, only three organisations \u2013 Future Super, Australian Super and NAB \u2013 indicated they had assessed the risks and opportunities, and only 40% had plans to do so.

Both Anthony Albanese and Scott Morrison have mostly failed to discuss poverty in the public forum, although a few Labor MPs have broken party lines to say they support an immediate increase to jobseeker. The Greens and a lot of smaller parties and independents have an increase in welfare payments as their policy. I believe the lack of having these conversations just shows how out of touch Australian politicians actually are. Both sides are talking about the cost of living but leave out the impacts this is having on people living below the poverty line who are impacted the most. Living on $330 a week is unsustainable and I can\u2019t help but wonder how long it\u2019s been since a politician had to choose between a loaf of bread or two litres of milk. If they have to walk around a supermarket with a calculator stopping to type in each product, afraid to go over a limit, and have to put things back at the checkout? Have they ever had to sleep in a tent instead of a house and not by choice? This is what Australians are facing and letting people access their super early isn\u2019t going to fix it. Whoever wins the next election has a big job ahead of them. I hope they also understand that governing the country is a privilege and not a right. They need to govern for all, not just the wealthy. After all, the poor vote too. Ignoring us won\u2019t make the problem of poverty go away. It will just make us louder. Poverty is and always has been a policy choice.

While the seat of Herbert is being hotly contested and inspiring some good old-fashioned pork-barreling, and the Coalition certainly capitalised on discretionary grants in their pre-election budget, it\u2019s difficult to determine which policies and commitments will amount to long-term sustainable growth for our region. Both major parties have committed $70m to the NQH2 Hydrogen Consortium and promised support to the Townsville City Deal. The Coalition supports Hells Gate dam and development of an industrial precinct in Ayr, while the opposition is promising manufacturing opportunities and backing the NQ SPARK defence simulation facility. A variety of policies to address the regional housing crisis have been announced and debated, from building tens of thousands of homes and lowering deposits for home buyers through to capping mortgage rates and the concept of government co-ownership. I fear that stimulating demand without properly addressing supply may inadvertently result in price hikes and the cynic in me questions the \u201cbenefits\u201d of quick-fix solutions to such a complex issue.

Covid was only muttered in the same breath as economic recovery, as our PM claimed credit for saving the country despite surging cases and record deaths. The health system is still under enormous strain and staff are fatigued from doing the actual saving, but Scott Morrison was too loudly singing his own praises to notice. He created distractions and behaved like Covid was a distant memory, basking in its afterglow while arguing workers getting slammed to drive his miraculous economic recovery didn\u2019t deserve a pay rise.  There\u2019s been no acknowledgement that all it took was a virus to expose the frightful inadequacies in our chronically underfunded healthcare system. No vision to create the brighter country that anxious Aussies dreamed we could become during the dark days of lockdowns. Only the Greens have made any attempt to better the healthcare system by announcing dental and mental into Medicare.

The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced on Wednesday that his government would build the 2,100 gigalitre dam \u2013 about four times the size of Sydney Harbour \u2013 that could potentially support 60,000ha of new land for irrigated agriculture. \u201cWe need to build more dams in Australia.

The government has said the funding is guaranteed, subject to the business case. Earlier feasibility studies have prompted serious questions about the project\u2019s stated economic benefit. Hells Gates also has no environmental impact statement, and no environmental approvals \u2013 a process that could take several years on such a large and complex project. Some locals leaders, including the Burdekin mayor, Lyn McLaughlin, have expressed concern that dam proposals in the Burdekin River catchment \u2013 including the Urannah Dam that also has federal support \u2013 have been pushed without studies about their long-term impact on the river system. Jami Webster, a water quality expert from the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the announcement was \u201celectioneering\u201d. Webster said the notion that irrigated agriculture could be expanded in the Burdekin Basin was a \u201cbig problem\u201d for the Great Barrier Reef, which is currently enduring a mass coral bleaching event. Last year, UN science advisors recommended the committee place the reef on a list of world heritage sites \u201cin danger\u201d because of the impacts of bleaching and a lack of progress in improving pollution levels. But fierce lobbying by the Australian government saw the 21-country committee ignore the recommendation. \u201cIf they were to build Hells Gates there would be a huge expansion of agriculture, which would likely result in a lot more sediment and nutrient pollution to the reef,\u201d Webster said. Significant work has been done in the Burdekin Basin to assist farmers reduce pollution heading out to the reef from the catchment. They include best-practice management programs for farmers and regulations imposed by the Queensland government. A significant amount of federal funding for the reef, distributed by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, goes towards programs to reduce sediment and nutrient run-off. \u201c[Expansion of agriculture] is a big problem,\u201d Webster said. \u201cThat is going to very quickly reverse a lot of the progress made by farmers and industry to date. We\u2019re still a long way to meeting our water quality targets and [Hells Gate] is only going to further hamper that progress.\u201d Webster said planning for the dam showed it would divert water from downstream areas in the Burdekin Basin, which would in turn increase the build-up of sediment. The North Queensland Conservation Council said it had obtained full technical reports from a 2018 feasibility study into Hells Gates Dam.

The organisation promoting the dam, Townsville Enterprise, says on its website that a detailed business case is due to be finalised in April. Morrison, in his press release on Wednesday, said the business case would not be ready until June. Independent MP for Kennedy, Bob Katter, has long called for the construction of the dam. But he said he opposed the prime minister\u2019s plan, claiming the dam would be too small to irrigate a large enough area in inland Queensland. Katter was also critical that it would be built on \u201cunreliable basalt rock country\u201d, and claimed locals would oppose it. \u201cThe prime minister thinks he\u2019s pushing a proposal that develops north Queensland when actually it destroys the future and potential of the region,\u201d he said. Asked in a press conference about Katter\u2019s concerns, Morrison said he had worked \u201cconstructively\u201d with the veteran MP, but stood by his plan. \u201cI love Bob, but it\u2019s not about Bob. And Bob would agree it\u2019s not about Bob,\u201d Morrison said. Townsville Enterprise says its initial study into Hells Gates showed it \u201chas the potential to redefine northern Queensland\u2019s agriculture sector and underpin long-term export market growth and investment\u201d. Morrison said the project would create 7,000 jobs during construction and 3,000 new jobs in agriculture. \u201cWater is a precious resource and we need more dams to better use that resource,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done the homework on Hells Gates Dam and it\u2019s now time to get on and build it. We have put our money on the table, so let\u2019s cut the green tape, get the approvals and get it done. \u201cThis dam will help turn the Burdekin region into an agricultural powerhouse, helping our farmers to stock supermarkets and feed Australia while also securing north Queensland\u2019s water supply and security.\u201d ", "Scott Morrison signals budget measures to counter soaring petrol prices and cost of living [2022-03-21T01:40:26Z]": "Scott Morrison has signalled further measures to counter the rising cost of living, potentially including temporary petrol excise cuts, as the Coalition mulls federal implications from the Liberal loss in South Australia. The prime minister travelled to Brisbane on Monday campaigning on the commonwealth\u2019s $667m investment in the south-east Queensland city deal, primarily for transport projects, ahead of the federal budget on 29 March. For weeks, the Morrison government has been signalling possible action on petrol prices and targeted cash payments for low- and middle-income earners as ways to combat the rising cost of living.   Related: Scott Morrison talks up tax cuts as pressure builds on petrol prices    In SA, Labor\u2019s Peter Malinauskas defeated the first term Liberal government with a 7% swing by campaigning on health funding and cost-of-living pressures. The victory is the first loss in Australia of an incumbent government since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, leading to warnings that Morrison had damaged the Liberal brand in the state, and that a bigger agenda for the next term of government could trump pandemic management in voters\u2019 minds. Morrison told reporters in Brisbane the government was \u201cvery conscious of cost-of-living impacts, particularly at the moment, with the war in Ukraine and the impact that that is especially having on fuel prices\u201d. He argued high fuel prices, which have hit $2.20 in some parts of Australia, \u201cdon\u2019t just hit the economy and hit family budgets when they fill up, but they have a knock-on effect across the economy\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve been carefully considering our response to ensure that we can deliver a budget that both addresses those immediate needs but also ensures that we continue on with our strong economic plan for a stronger economy.\u201d Earlier, Morrison told 4BC radio that the spike in petrol prices \u201cwon\u2019t go forever\u201d and the government would not engage in a \u201ckneejerk\u201d response, suggesting that any move to reduce excise, which adds 44.2 cents to the price of petrol, would be temporary. Mark Butler, the federal Labor health spokesperson and a senior South Australian in Anthony Albanese\u2019s shadow ministry, said that Malinauskas, like federal Labor, had \u201cbeen very busy preparing a focused policy agenda that would look beyond the pandemic\u201d.    Butler said that defeated premier, Stephen Marshall, and the federal Liberals \u201cconsistently pat themselves on the back about the state of the economy\u201d. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t reflect the real lives of working Australians,\u201d Butler told ABC Radio National. \u201cHousehold budgets are being smashed by flat wages and rising household costs.\u201d \u201cTalking to the economic reality of Australia today is a strong lesson out of the South Australian election,\u201d he said, in addition to a focus on healthcare.

On Sunday the Grattan Institute released a report finding that both major parties had targeted their election spending promises at marginal seats and just one of the 71 Coalition transport promises worth $100m or more was based on a business case approved by Infrastructure Australia. Morrison insisted that \u201cevery electorate in every part of the country obviously matters\u201d. \u201cThe city deals are developed as a partnership,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the priorities for the projects are worked up between the parties.\u201d", "Peter Dutton may be sorry for not saying sorry, but he\u2019s still in no man\u2019s land on the voice | Katharine Murphy [2023-02-13T06:57:38Z]": "Peter Dutton is sorry for not saying sorry. He wasn\u2019t there when Kevin Rudd delivered the landmark apology to the stolen generations in the House of Representatives in 2008 because the ghost of Peter past boycotted the event. Dutton\u2019s pivot has been in train for some months. After he took the Liberal leadership last year, he acknowledged he had \u201cmade a mistake\u201d in 2008. But a motion in the House of Representatives on Monday marking the 15th anniversary of Rudd\u2019s apology demanded a more substantial atonement from an alternative prime minister of Australia. Dutton\u2019s \u201cmistake\u201d had been acknowledged initially in response to a journalist\u2019s question, but Monday required a bespoke message for survivors \u2013 and for voters who think Dutton is a head kicker from Queensland and can never be anything other than a head kicker from Queensland.   Related: Dutton apologises for boycotting Rudd\u2019s apology to stolen generations     Dutton has spent the summer running a soft no campaign on the voice to parliament. One of Labor\u2019s responses to the summer of soft no has been reminding Dutton regularly that he screwed up in 2008. The point of Anthony Albanese and Linda Burney re-litigating 2008 is obvious. You did the wrong thing then. Are you going to do the wrong thing now? For now, this question remains open. While Dutton searches for his answer, the anniversary forced a more extended reckoning with 2008. In the chamber, Dutton said he wanted to explain the past in an \u201cunscripted\u201d way. Dutton said he couldn\u2019t say sorry back then because the ghost of Peter past possessed the mind of a cop \u2013 one of his pre-politics professions. He was haunted by images of domestic violence, and abused women and children. Back in 2008, he felt the time for apologies would be after those problems were fixed. I\u2019m certain Dutton saw absolutely unspeakable things while on the beat, things that must haunt him. But Monday\u2019s words beg a simple question. Can the alternative prime minister of Australia only process things he can see? If this is right, it\u2019s strange that Dutton missed the survivors who wept in Canberra in 2008. They weren\u2019t just in the chamber. Strange he missed Pat Dodson, a parliamentary colleague since 2016, and a First Nations leader for many years before that. Albanese reminded Australians on Monday that Dodson hid in the long grass as a young child to avoid being rounded up and removed with some of his peers. The contours of that terrified kid remain clearly visible in a man who has spent a lifetime striving for grace, and campaigning for justice and reconciliation.   Related: Linda Burney warns MPs who walked out on apology not to \u2018repeat the mistake\u2019 with the voice    It\u2019s quite hard to fathom how a person can see one atrocity with piercing clarity, but struggle to visualise another, particularly when the invisible atrocity continues to inform the visible one. That\u2019s how inter-generational trauma works. The part relates to the whole. If reconciliation is to be a bipartisan endeavour in this country, Dutton needs to do better than selective seeing. Seeing the whole, seeing how the parts connect, is what this moment demands, because seeing that is the necessary precursor to action. I\u2019m sure Dutton has learned things since his failure of judgment in 2008 because it is the way of humans to learn more from our mistakes than our triumphs.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The relevant question before us, though, is not how much this political leader has learned. The question is how will he put his learning to use. And right now, that\u2019s not clear. Dutton and Albanese continue to circle one another wondering if there is a universe where this referendum campaign can be a moment of unity rather than a moment of psychic injury. Liberals who support the voice want Albanese to give them a set of conditions, both practical and procedural, where they can say yes. Albanese wants something different: the Liberals to endorse the principle of constitutional recognition now, then work through the detail in an ensuing parliamentary process.

The Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) has partnered with Prof Peter Corke, a robotics expert, to develop a shortlist of new technologies that could improve safety and scientific research on the continent.

Migration levels The government will maintain the 2022-23 permanent migration planned intake at 160,000. Skilled migration places will increase from the 2021-22 planning levels to 109,900, and account for about 70% of the permanent migration program. The government is redistributing 10,000 unused places from the partner program into the skilled program. The humanitarian program is capped at 13,750 for 2022-23 and for the forward estimates. Cheaper visas The budget contains a number of tweaks to visa conditions and costs, in an effort to attract international students and backpackers to come to Australia, after pandemic border closures saw a dramatic fall in numbers. An incentive program which involves refunding visa fees for international students who arrive by 19 March, and working holidaymakers who arrive by 19 April, will cost the budget money, but those arriving will pay tax and relieve the staff shortages in hospitality. The government is also increasing country caps for work and holiday visas by 30% in 2022-23, to allow in 11,000 backpackers. Tax changes have been foreshadowed for workers under the Australian agriculture visa scheme, with the government saying it will \u201cclarify\u201d the tax treatment soon \u201cto respond to workforce shortages in the agriculture and primary industry sectors\u201d.

Sounds like a no brainer. Black economy measures deferred Data system changes can be very slow, it seems. The government will defer for a year the start date of a measure announced in the 2019-20 budget to strengthen the Australian Business Number system, which is aimed at curbing the black economy. The cost of the deferral is said to be small: $5m. ABC and SBS funding \u2013 in case you missed it The government announced funding for the ABC and SBS in February. It locked in $3.3bn in funding for the ABC from July 2022 to June 2025, an increase of $87.2m over the current triennial funding period, thanks to the restoration of indexing and continuation of its enhanced newsgathering program that provides news services to the regions.

It is the most short-sighted budget in memory \u2013 it has a shelf life of about six or seven weeks.\u201d Riding a wave of increased revenue driven by a tight jobs market, soaring commodity prices and lower-than- expected payments, the government has revised down forecast deficits by $103.6bn over the five years to 2025-26 compared with the midyear budget update. The budget documents show the underlying cash balance has improved $38.1bn in 2022-23, and by $114.6bn over the four years to 2025-26. But while the government has banked most of this to improve the budget bottom line, the total cost of policy decisions is $17.2bn next year and $30.4bn over the four years to 2025-26.

Australia\u2019s unemployment rate will drop to 3.75% in the September quarter this year, its lowest figure in 50 years and three percentage points lower than the 7% doomsday scenario predicted in last year\u2019s budget. As a result of the booming jobs market, the budget says wage growth is on track to accelerate at its fastest pace in almost a decade, with the wage price index to jump from 2.75% this year to 3.25% next year. \u201cBroader and more representative wage measures are picking up more quickly as workers take advantage of the tight labour market, with average earnings per hour expected to increase by 5 per cent through the year to the June quarter of 2022,\u201d budget papers say.

The budget papers show that wages grew at less than half the rate of inflation in 2020-21, with prices rising 3.8% and wages falling behind, growing a mere 1.7%. Labor has already cast doubt on the government\u2019s wage growth predictions, pointing to the 52 of 55 forecasts of wage growth that have not eventuated under the Coalition\u2019s watch. And, despite the government forecasting wages growth to accelerate at their fastest rate in a decade, real wages are not likely to recover to 2019 levels until 2025. Frydenberg defended the wage growth forecasts, saying the broader national accounts measure of average earnings, which captured total remuneration including bonuses, overtime and allowances, showed stronger wage rises. Under the cost of living package, the low and middle income tax offset will be increased by $420, meaning all workers earning up to $126,000 a year will receive an extra boost when they lodge their tax return for this year. This will increase the maximum amount to $1,500 for a single income household and $3,000 for a two-income household, with the boost costing the budget an extra $4.1bn. The $250 tax-free cost of living payment will go to 6 million eligible Australian pensioners, welfare recipients, veterans and concession card holders \u201cwithin weeks\u201d. Frydenberg said the cost of living package was designed to provide temporary and practical help for household budgets to deal with the rising cost of living. \u201cEvents abroad are pushing up the cost of living at home,\u201d he said in his budget speech. \u201cHigher fuel, food and shipping costs are increasing inflation and stretching household budgets. \u201cThis budget\u2019s new cost of living package is responsible and targeted, delivering cheaper fuel, cheaper medicines and putting more money in the pockets of millions of Australians.\u201d   Related: At this gravest of times the Coalition has served up an election budget designed simply to keep itself in power |  | Katharine Murphy    The budget also includes a small business package that will give a tax incentive for investment in skills, training and digital technology, with a tax deduction of $120 for every $100 spent in these areas up to $100,000 a year. A skills package includes $2.8bn for apprentices and $2.2bn for innovation at universities, while an extra $1bn will be spent on the government\u2019s modern manufacturing strategy. The budget papers also lay out the cost of the government\u2019s flood relief and recovery effort for the New South Wales and Queensland floods, which is expected to be more than $6bn, with $3.6bn already spent. An extra $4.7bn is being spent on health services, while an extra $1.3bn will be put towards the delivery of the national plan to end violence against women and children. On defence, the government has massively ramped up spending over the next decade, including a $9.9bn commitment towards cyber \u2013 known as Redspice \u2013 with about $600m of this allocated over the forward estimates. Chalmers said Labor would support the cost-of-living relief, and rejected suggestions that the extra financial support was not necessary given that the budget papers show household disposable income increasing by about 11% since the start of the pandemic. \u201cOf course now we\u2019ve got petrol prices, grocery prices, building materials, rent, all going through the roof at the same time as real wages are going backwards, and so we do have families under genuine cost-of-living pressures,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cAnd the government is now pretending to care about those costly pressures because Scott Morrison has to call an election in the next fortnight.\u201d", "Team spirit: the Australian agave farm aiming to quench a global thirst for tequila [2022-12-09T14:00:37Z]": "The plants may look like pineapples but these fields in north Queensland are growing pi\u00f1a of another kind \u2013 Agave tequilana.

Distilled from fermented juice from the heart \u2013 or pi\u00f1a \u2013 of the agave plant, agave spirits include mezcal as well as the lesser-known raicilla and bacanora, but according to ISWR, a company that analyses alcohol trends worldwide, it is tequila that is driving the premium agave spirits boom, with a market increase of 16% between the first half of 2022 and the same period in 2021. Australia is now the third-largest market for tequila outside North and Latin America.

We see trends towards premiumisation and also less is more. \u201cWe think with greater health consciousness prevalent among younger consumers, agave in particular is well placed to take advantage of this trend. They understand the connection between the drink and the plant. This has been a key factor in the growth of tequila in the US.\u201d It\u2019s a propitious time to be entering the market, with what IWSR has flagged as an \u201cunprecedented\u201d demand for tequila leading to agave shortages and higher production costs in Mexico. TSI\u2019s distiller, Sebastian Reaburn, says that far from resenting the competition, the Mexicans have been supportive. \u201cA lot of the people within the industry in Mexico look at what we are doing as like what happened to champagne through the 1970s when Australia started to manufacture sparkling wine,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was good for champagne.\u201d   Related: Tequila time: why Mexico\u2019s signature spirit is having a moment    Only about 8% of spirits sold in Australia are made here, compared with beer at 80% and wine at 75%, according to TSI, but demand for premium, high-quality Australian spirits is forecast to increase over the next five years.

Future RBA rate rises will hinge on them. \nChalmers\u2019 numbers will also be updated in the out-of-cycle budget he will bring down in October.

Chalmers is seeking to distinguish his approach from the near-decade of Coalition rule that preceded it. \nAnyone hoping for extra cost-of-living relief would have been disappointed but probably not surprised. Chalmers will probably save any sweeteners \u2013 if there are any \u2013 for his budget, but there is actually little room for the government to move. \nChildcare support, cheaper medical prescriptions and spending on a modernised electricity grid to allow faster take-up of low-cost renewable energy were his main offerings that we\u2019ve heard about before. \n\u201cThey are very boxed in by election promises,\u201d says John Hawkins, a senior lecturer at the University of Canberra who served as a senior economist with both Treasury and the RBA. That means the fuel excise cut \u2013 costing $3bn for just six months \u2013 won\u2019t be extended and nor will the low- and middle-income tax offset. \n\u201cEven if they do try to give people money to compensate for the cost of living pressures, that\u2019s just going to stimulate the economy more,\u201d Hawkins says. To spend more would be having the \u201cRBA jumping on the brake and the government jumping on the accelerator\u201d. \nChalmers\u2019 speech, though, was partly aimed at massaging expectations, particularly for workers anxious their wages are not keeping up with inflation \u2013 in fact are falling further behind. \nFor now, the treasurer is projecting 2023-24 as the year wages finally grow faster than headline inflation.

The March quarter WPI was 2.4% and Chalmers\u2019 update on Thursday pencilled in 2.75% for the year to June. \n\u201cIt\u2019s surprising how little acceleration there has been in wages at a time when the unemployment rate is down to 3.5%,\u201d Hawkins says. \nThat may change as employers bid against each other to fill vacancies. Still, the Treasury estimates only project WPI quickening to 3.75% by June 2023 \u2013 a level it will hold roughly firm for the years out to June 2026. \nAnother constraint on the budget \u2013 and hence, on Chalmers\u2019 inclination to spend \u2013 are the mounting costs.

The federal education minister, Jason Clare, announced on Tuesday a review of the agency, which administers around $800m in funding each year to Australian researchers.   Related: International researchers shun Australia after government vetoing of grants, expert says    A Senate committee found in March that the ARC Act \u201cmay no longer be fit for purpose\u201d and recommended a review of the agency in light of \u201cbroader concerns about the ARC and its governance and research funding processes\u201d. The Senate inquiry was held after widespread condemnation of a decision last year by the Coalition MP Stuart Robert, then the acting education minister, to veto funding for six ARC research grants in the humanities. Clare said in a statement on Tuesday that the review would \u201clook at the role and purpose of the ARC within our research system\u201d and would be led by Prof Margaret Sheil, the vice-chancellor of the Queensland University of Technology. The ARC would also be required to ensure \u201cfuture grant rounds are delivered on time to a pre-determined timeframe\u201d, Clare said.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning  News of the review had been generally embraced by the academic community. \u201cI welcome in principle an open look into how the ARC is performing,\u201d said Prof Sven Rogge, the pro-vice-chancellor of research at the University of New South Wales.  In light of the reform, a planned three-yearly assessment of university research performance, known as the Excellence in Research for Australia, would no longer take place in 2023. Prof Emma Johnston, the deputy vice-chancellor of research at the University of Sydney, who welcomed the \u201ctimely review\u201d, described the move in a tweet as \u201ca reprieve from the administrative burden of the ERA assessment\u201d. However, researchers had concerns about the \u201cnational interest test\u201d, which Clare signalled would remain. It was introduced in 2018 by the Coalition, and had been criticised by academics because a \u201cnational benefit test\u201d already existed for ARC grant schemes. \u201cThe national interest test should continue but should be clearer, simpler, and easily understood,\u201d Clare said. \u201cThe national interest test is intended to ask the applicant to showcase why their research would benefit the Australian taxpayer, which is absolutely fair enough,\u201d said Rogge, who is also president of the Australian Institute of Physics. \u201cThe issue is that if you interpret benefit to the Australian taxpayer as, for example, creating a translatable commercial outcome within three years, then there will be a very narrow scope that would kill a lot of work that in the long run will lead to translation,\u201d he said, citing GPS and quantum technology as examples of fundamental research with long-term benefits. The Australian researcher who runs the Twitter account ARC Tracker, who wished to remain anonymous, said they were disappointed the national interest test would remain, but that \u201cthings seem to be moving in a more helpful direction\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a relic, taking up tonnes of everyone\u2019s time and it will achieve precisely zero improvement in the research or its outcomes,\u201d the account\u2019s administrator said. Senator Mehreen Faruqi, the Greens education spokesperson, described the national interest test as \u201ccompletely unnecessary and onerous\u201d.   Related: Academics condemn government\u2019s \u2018shortsighted\u2019 decision to veto research grants    Faruqi, who had pushed for the Senate inquiry into the ARC earlier this year, said in a statement: \u201cThe ministerial veto power and the national interest test have to go. Scrapping the veto power is overwhelmingly backed by universities and researchers.\u201d \u201cThe review should not narrow itself to governance and operations.

One of the most significant measures in the state\u2019s budget, handed down on Tuesday, was a \u201cwatershed\u201d $2bn fund that would build renewables and further develop industries linked to clean energy. The budget is being sold by the treasurer, Cameron Dick, as a vindication of Covid lockdowns, border closures and the decision to use debt to fund the economic recovery.   Related: Biloela family to be reunited in Perth but will remain in community detention    Dick said that since the onset of the pandemic, Queensland\u2019s job numbers have grown by 253,000 and the state\u2019s economy has outperformed the rest of the country. \u201cOur economy is succeeding because we protected the health of Queenslanders,\u201d Dick said. \u201cIn this budget we are reducing our debt because our economy is growing strongly, because our jobs are coming back and because it makes sense to rebuild our borrowing capacity. \u201cIn future, debt may well rise again, to respond to another crisis \u2026 or to build the infrastructure of our state. \u201cAs we see the commonwealth government engaging in a borrowing spree that dwarfs anything the state might do, it is my hope that [the opposition] and those in the media finally come to grips with the fact that debt is not a dirty word.\u201d Dick projects Queensland will return to surplus in 2024-25. In the process, perhaps inadvertently, the budget highlights how the state\u2019s future planning is being gradually decoupled from once-critical revenue streams \u2013 including coal royalties and dividends from power companies. Both have been frequent boasts by the fossil fuel sector to underscore their importance to the state. Total revenue is predicted to increase $11.7bn over the forward estimates. At the same time the state projects its royalties income \u2013 mostly from mining \u2013 will be down $767m. Those numbers only tell part of the story. In 2019-20, Queensland made $3.52bn from royalties paid by coal exporters. The following year \u2013 in part due to the pandemic \u2013 the state made less than half that amount ($1.75bn). While treasury\u2019s projections show coal exports bouncing, they are not predicted to ever return to heady pre-2020 levels. Power generation and electricity networks have long been a reliable income stream for the state \u2013 in the 2017-18 financial year these returned $1.6bn to the state\u2019s coffers. In three years, 90% of the state\u2019s dividends from its power companies has evaporated \u2013 in 2020-21, the figure is estimated at $152m. By the 2022-23 financial year, Queensland no longer expects to receive any dividends from its power generators. \u201cThe entry of significant volumes of renewables boosting supply into the grid [has put] sustained downward pressure on wholesale electricity prices,\u201d the budget papers say. \u201cGiven the soft market outlook, dividends from the [energy] generation sector have not been assumed in the later years of the forward estimates.\u201d On the morning of the budget, the Queensland Conservation Council released an analysis that showed the state\u2019s coal-fired power stations will become loss-makers from 2023.

But despite the treasurer hailing an \u201cincredible\u201d set of job numbers, which shows Australia\u2019s unemployment rate will fall comfortably below 5% next year, the government is holding off the task of budget repair until \u201ceconomic recovery is secure\u201d. \u201cThese gains are not yet locked in,\u201d Josh Frydenberg said on Thursday as he announced the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo). \u201cThe pandemic is still with us and we must continue to learn to live with the virus as demonstrated by the recent emergence of the Omicron variant.\u201d   Related: Federal budget update: Josh Frydenberg forecasts unemployment rate to fall to under 5%    The economic update \u2013 potentially the last before the election \u2013 shows a combined $15.9bn in expenditure for decisions \u201ctaken but not yet announced\u201d and other mystery spending that is not for publication. Treasury officials suggested the spending was split about 50-50 between these two categories. Frydenberg dismissed suggestions this was an election fighting fund, and refused to provide a breakdown of the figure, which allocates almost $10bn to spending this year and next year across both categories. \u201cThey are measures that we expect to eventuate, but at this point, we can\u2019t allocate and confirm to specific programs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat goes into a contingency reserve can be a number of specific initiatives, including those that are commercial in confidence and therefore can\u2019t be revealed.\u201d Last year\u2019s Myefo allocated just $1.5bn for similar unannounced measures, but the figure routinely balloons ahead of each federal election. Frydenberg said this spending could include the purchase of vaccines or other necessary health supports, as well as reserves for decisions made that would be confirmed in the March budget.There is also $940m in unknown revenue measures due to decisions taken but not announced or not for publication. Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers slammed the government\u2019s economic update, saying it was \u201cmore of the same rorts, more of the same waste, more of the same missed opportunities\u201d that had characterised the government. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t understand is this. You can\u2019t rort your way to recovery. We don\u2019t want to see secret slush funds before the election and secret cuts to the budget after the election,\u201d he said. He said there was little focus on trying to build an economy and society that was better than before the pandemic, saying it \u201ccompletely ignores\u201d the issues of stagnant wages, skills shortages and job insecurity. The unemployment rate in 2021-22 is expected to be 4.5%, down from the 5% forecast in the May budget, dropping to 4.25% in 2022-23. Frydenberg said the \u201crecord high\u201d employment means there were now 180,000 more people in work than at the start of the pandemic. Wage growth will begin to outpace inflation in 2022-23 when wages are expected to grow 2.75% compared to an inflation rate of 2.5%. Wages then grow 3% in 2023-24 and 3.25% in 2024-25, compared to inflation of 2.5% in both of these years. In 2020-21, inflation was more than double the rate of wage increases. The government has downgraded its growth forecasts to 3.75% in the current financial year, down from 4.25% forecast in the May budget, but has upgraded its gross domestic product forecasts for next year to 3.5%, up from 2.5%. The following year, in 2023-24, growth then falls to just 2.25%, below Australia\u2019s average pre-pandemic growth rates, before lifting to 2.5% in 2024-25. Frydenberg flags uncertainty While the treasurer said Australians had reason to feel confident about the forthcoming recovery, the budget papers warn that the government numbers could be \u201csubstantially different\u201d to those forecast, depending on what happens with the pandemic. It assumes that lockdowns and state border closures are no longer required, most domestic restrictions are lifted by early in 2022, and \u201conly baseline levels of physical distancing and density restrictions\u201d remaining in the first half of next year. \u201cThe Omicron variant is not assumed to significantly alter current reopening plans or require a reimposition of widespread health and activity restrictions,\u201d the document says.   Related: Scott Morrison says Omicron won\u2019t \u2018take us back\u2019 to Covid restrictions as he announces Moderna deal    However, after the Delta variant proved more of an impediment to the global economic recovery than anticipated at the budget, the papers also warn that the global economic outlook will remain \u201csusceptible to new waves of the virus for some time\u201d. \u201cThe ongoing impact of the pandemic means the economic outlook remains highly uncertain,\u201d the Myefo papers say.    Myefo outlines two different scenarios \u2013 one better, and one worse than the budget papers forecast. In a \u201cdownside scenario\u201d predicated on new variants of concern requiring a significant response and local lockdowns, economic activity would be around $20bn lower in 2021-22, wiping 1 percentage point off GDP in 2021-22 and hiking unemployment up by 1%. In a possible \u201cupside scenario\u201d where households and businesses started to spend savings more quickly, economic activity could increase by around $30bn across 2021-22 and 2022-23, a GDP increase of 0.5% this year and 1% next year compared to forecasts. Employment would be stronger in this scenario, putting downward pressure on unemployment, but the impact is likely to be small as it would also encourage greater participation. \u201cOn the downside, the new Omicron variant highlights the ongoing risk of outbreaks which have the potential to damage confidence or require a reimposition of health measures and activity restrictions,\u201d the papers say. Despite a $95bn upgrade in tax receipts over the four-year forward estimates, spending on the NDIS of $26.4bn and $25bn in extra Covid support payments has seen the government deficits across the forward estimates remain relatively unchanged. Budget deficits set to continue for years The government has posted a revised deficit of $99.2bn for this year, a $7.4bn improvement since May. But across the forward estimates, the cumulative deficits are only $2.3bn better than forecast, leaving a $57.5bn deficit in 2024-25, the equivalent of 2.3% of GDP. The cumulative budget deficits, which were forecast at $342.4bn in the May budget, now total $340bn. Over the medium term, the budget is still expected to remain in deficit by 2031-32, improving to a deficit of 1.8% of GDP in ten years\u2019 time. Gross debt, which tops $1tn in 2022-23 and is expected to stabilise at about 50% of GDP in the medium term, has come down slightly since the May budget.

This is in addition to the $250m committed in the May budget for a sixth round of the project, taking the total to about $1.4bn. The Myefo papers also show the government has agreed in principle to the extension of inland rail from Toowoomba to the Port of Gladstone in Queensland \u2013 a project long promoted by Barnaby Joyce \u2013 \u201csubject to the outcomes of the business case demonstrating the project is economically beneficial\u201d. The improved unemployment rate \u2013 which refers to the share of the labour force that is without work and seeking employment \u2013 suggests an extra 150,000 people will be employed by 2024-25 across the economy than forecast in the May 2021-22 budget. The strong jobs growth will result in a record employment-to-population ratio of 63.1% by the September quarter next year. The lower than forecast unemployment rate is in line with the government\u2019s updated \u201cnon-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment\u201d, called the Nairu, which is the jobless rate at which inflation and wages are then expected to rise. But the treasurer, who had previously flagged the government would turn to the second phase of its economic recovery plan once the unemployment rate was about 4%, said there remained much uncertainty in the economy. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of uncertainty right now. We\u2019re living in the middle of a pandemic, the biggest economic shock since the great depression,\u201d Frydenberg said. The Myefo papers show a total of $337bn in commonwealth support has been spent as a result of the pandemic, equivalent to 16.3% of GDP.", "Employee at collapsed Youpla funeral fund allegedly used racial slur about Aboriginal clients [2022-05-25T03:55:01Z]": "An employee at the now-collapsed Aboriginal Community Benefits Fund (ACBF) allegedly described its Aboriginal clients as \u201cblack cunts\u201d and directed another sales representative going door-to-door to sign people up even if they were drinking alcohol, according to internal emails seen by Guardian Australia. \nThe ACBF, later trading as Youpla, was a Gold Coast-based private business that aggressively sold low-value funeral insurance almost exclusively to Aboriginal people, including children and babies, the financial ombudsman has repeatedly found. \nThe company went into liquidation in March, leaving thousands of Aboriginal people unable to pay for their funerals, and raising questions about whether any of the more than 13,000 clients will be able to recover what they paid in premiums. \n \n  Related: Yachts and mansions: founder of company that left thousands of Aboriginal people out of pocket made more than $20m, tax-free  \n \nThe company\u2019s sales tactics and corporate conduct were exposed at the 2018 banking royal commission, and in dozens of subsequent determinations by the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. \nNow Guardian Australia can reveal that the company\u2019s founder and senior management were aware in 2017 of allegations that at least one sales representative had acted unconscionably. \nIn April 2017, a concerned staff member wrote to a manager, who forwarded the complaint to ACBF founder Ron Pattenden, saying they were \u201cmortified\u201d by a conversation they had with a colleague while door-knocking in an Aboriginal community in Queensland. \n  \n  \n   \n    What is ACBF/Youpla?\n    \n    \n     The Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund (ACBF) was a Gold Coast-based private business that for decades aggressively sold funeral insurance almost exclusively to Aboriginal people, including children and babies\n     At its peak ACBF had about 25,000 clients.

As i have 1/3 aboriginal in myself and to hear my own work colleague speak like we are nothing really broke my heart.\u201d \nIt is unclear from the documents whether these allegations were formally investigated by ACBF management. Youpla and Pattenden did not respond to requests for comment. \nHowever, it is clear they were noted.

Afca also repeatedly found that people signed documents they could not read, or were unable to comprehend. \nCases included: \n \n An Aboriginal woman with three children aged six, eight and nine when she signed them up in 2006 said the ACBF representative completed the application form and health statement and showed her where to sign them. The ombudsman said that \u201ceven to the untrained eye\u201d the signatures on two forms she was supposed to have signed were different. \n An Aboriginal woman with diabetes, a hearing impairment and an intellectual disability, and who could not read or write except to sign her name, told the ombudsman the representative completed some forms and got her to sign them without explaining them to her. She did not know which documents she signed and could not understand the documents she was given, as she could not read. \n A 52-year-old Aboriginal man was at his sister\u2019s house in May 2007 when encouraged to sign up to ACBF. The ombudsman noted inconsistencies in the paperwork: \u201cI note the application form is dated 2 June 2007, has a witness signature dated 18 May 2007, and is signed by a consultant dated 25 May 2007.\u201d \n \nIn each case, the ombudsman found that ACBF should repay the clients all that they had paid into the fund, plus interest. \nGuardian Australia has spoken to policyholders who say that even as the fund was collapsing in March 2022, it continued to give them inconsistent information. \nGamilaroi woman Kayla Lawton looks set to lose the $10,000 of premiums in the ACBF collapse. Lawton\u2019s mother, who has heart problems and dementia, also paid $10,000. \nWhen Lawton found out via Facebook that the company had collapsed she called the liquidator to find out more. \n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t give me any clarity on what was going to happen,\u201d Lawton said, and asked her to contact Youpla about her policy. \u201cThen, I ended up getting an email from Youpla themselves on the 22nd of March, basically saying that if I cancel my fund, then they\u2019re not going to cover anything if me or my kids were to pass away. \n\u201cI should not have received that email, because it\u2019s very misleading.\u201d \nThe email from Youpla \u201ccustomer care\u201d, seen by Guardian Australia, said that, while they could cancel her funeral plan if Kayla wished, if she were to cancel, there would be no \u201crefund or cancellation payment and there will be no benefit available for your [sic] or your nominees in the event of passing\u201d. \nThe email did not advise Kayla that the company was no longer trading, despite being sent to her 11 days after it had gone into liquidation. \n\u201cI\u2019m just disgusted in the whole thing, especially with that email,\u201d Lawton says. \u201cImagine if a lot of aunts and uncles got that email, they would have been ringing up saying, \u2018yep, keep my payments going\u2019, believing that they\u2019re still trading, which they weren\u2019t.\u201d \nYoupla\u2019s liquidator, David Stimpson of SV Partners, said the email was \u201can error and I am aware of only one such email that was issued\u201d. \n \n  Related: Government under pressure to help Aboriginal families after \u2018predatory\u2019 funeral insurer\u2019s collapse  \n \n\u201cWe advised Youpla staff not to issue such emails back in late March,\u201d he said. \nIn its most recent update to claimants, SV Partners said members could still make a claim for funeral funds but \u201cwe cannot guarantee payments for funerals at this time\u201d. \nThe liquidator said it would be at least three months before they could advise members how and when any moneys recovered may be distributed. \n\u201cThere are a lot of members in all of the funds and this whole process will likely take more than 12 months to finalise,\u201d he said. \nLawton says she is \u201cangry, stressed and upset\u201d that she will probably have to take out a loan to pay for her mum\u2019s funeral when the time comes.

The leaders will on Friday discuss what to do about the 27,000 Australians stranded overseas. They will be briefed by the former senior bureaucrat, Jane Halton, who has been conducting a national review of hotel quarantine. Political pressure has been mounting on the commonwealth because of the large number of Australians unable to get home. Earlier this week, the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, shifted responsibility for repatriating them back on to the states and territories, demanding their leaders jointly increase arrival caps by 2,000 a week. New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia have been asked to take 500 additional arrivals a week and South Australia an extra 360. Ahead of Friday\u2019s discussion, Morrison warned his state and territory counterparts the cap would be lifted and they would need to deal with the consequences. \u201cThe planes will land with people on them and they\u2019ll be arriving.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a decision,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a proposal.\u201d   Related: Nine and News Corp donate advertising space to back Qantas push for open borders    Stephen Byron, the managing director of Canberra airport, says he has approached the government proposing relaxing quarantine requirements for those coming from New Zealand. He said this would be a simple way to allow Australian trapped in New Zealand to come home as well as easing pressure on hotel quarantine allowing more people from other countries to enter. \u201cWe have got to create room in the caps, it doesn\u2019t make any sense for us to take up available hotel quarantine rooms with people who are coming from a country where there is no, or next to no, Covid,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat it would do would free up between 15-20% of available capacity. It would be like a 15-20% boost in the numbers. \u201cIf we are saying as a nation that it is safe to travel to Sydney to Brisbane and the border should be open, then it is safe to travel from Auckland and Wellington to Syndey, Canberra, Brisbane and so on.\u201d Byron said this move could also increase international travel demand for airlines and airports who are financially struggling during the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s just the logical next step,\u201d he said. The move could also potentially allow some international arrivals at Melbourne airport \u2013 something which has been impossible since the pausing of the state\u2019s hotel quarantine program.

The commonwealth is providing 50% of the cost of activities responding to the pandemic in hospitals, including a private hospital agreement to ensure access to beds. In a statement ahead of the national cabinet meeting, Morrison said providing telehealth and home delivery medicine services reduced the risk of exposure of Covid-19 in the community \u201cwhile also supporting people in isolation to get the care they need\u201d. He said the funding would cover mental health services, delivered over the phone. \u201cAs we continue to suppress Covid-19 while continuing to open our economy up, Australians can be reassured that we have the world\u2019s best medical support in place to protect their health,\u201d Morrison said.", " Coalition\u2019s $1 billion pledge for Great Barrier Reef [2022-01-27T16:30:36Z]": "A re-elected Coalition would pour $1bn into Great Barrier Reef conservation projects over the next decade, the government says, just months after campaigning to prevent the reef being listed as \u201cin danger\u201d by the world heritage committee. The announcement, to be made by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, in north Queensland on Friday, comes a fortnight after Labor pledged $163m to protect the natural wonder. It highlights the reef as a key election fight in the Cairns electorate of Leichhardt. The funding pledge arrives just days before Australia is due to send a report to Unesco about the state of the reef and its plans to protect it, before a critical meeting of the world heritage committee scheduled for July in Russia.

Another $253m will specifically address reef management and conservation, including work from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to combat crown-of-thorns starfish and prevent illegal fishing. Other funds will go towards reef health monitoring systems and research into reef resilience, and $74.4m will target habitat restoration, marine debris and species protection in programs led by traditional owners and community groups. The government said its proposal would almost double the number of areas to be protected from crown-of-thorns starfish, from 253 to 500 reefs, as well as encouraging local farmers to improve land management to reduce agricultural runoff into the ocean. \u201cThis is already the best managed reef in the world and today we take our commitment to a new level,\u201d Morrison said, ahead of the official announcement in Cairns on Friday. The new policy is in addition to the government\u2019s previously announced $2bn for the Reef 2050 plan. On top of its environmental benefits, Morrison painted the announcement as reinforcement for the 64,000 jobs and $6.4bn in tourism revenue supported by the reef. \u201cFrom breakthrough science in coral seeding and restoration to improved water quality, the latest on water management and compliance systems, as well as the protection of native species, we are working across every aspect of the reef,\u201d the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said. \u201cOur farmers, tourism operators and fishers are our reef champions and we are supporting them through practical water- and land-based strategies that will contribute significantly to the health of the reef.\u201d Ley and the government\u2019s marine science experts agree the greatest threat to the world\u2019s biggest coral reef system is climate change. The 2,300km reef has seen five mass bleaching events \u2013 in 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020 \u2013 all caused by rising ocean temperatures driven by global heating.   Related: Australian government\u2019s plan to protect Great Barrier Reef falls short, environment groups say    In December the government released the first revision in five years of its cornerstone reef conservation policy, the Reef 2050 plan. Conservationists said the plan was flawed because it was linked to the Morrison government\u2019s inadequate greenhouse gas reduction targets. But they also said more funding and action was needed to improve water quality and address unsustainable and illegal fishing. Before Christmas, Labor said it would adopt a target to cut emissions by 43% by 2030 based on 2005 levels \u2013 slightly lower than the 45% target it took to the 2019 election but higher than the Morrison government\u2019s target of a 26-28% cut. Last year UN science advisers recommended the reef be placed on the world heritage \u201cin danger\u201d list \u2013 the first time any site had been recommended for the listing primarily because of the impacts of climate change. After a strong protest from the federal government, including dispatching Ley on a private jet to personally lobby world heritage committee members around the world, the reef was not given the listing. But the committee asked Australia to submit a report by 1 February this year on the reef\u2019s condition and the steps taken to protect it. A monitoring mission to be led by Unesco experts is also due to be held in the first half of this year before the world heritage committee considers again whether to put the reef on its list of sites \u201cin danger\u201d at its next meeting in July.

Veteran Liberal National party MP Warren Entsch is the government\u2019s special envoy for the reef. He held the seat of Leichhardt at the 2019 election by a 54-46% margin against Labor candidate Elida Faith, who will challenge for the seat again this year.", "The second coming of Mr Miracle or drag on the brand: could the Liberals decide Morrison is more problem than solution? | Katharine Murphy [2021-12-17T19:00:37Z]": "The year in politics has been brutal. The worst of it has been worse than dispiriting; parts have been nauseating. Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese have ended 2021 with a burst of campaigning, tracking between Queensland and Tasmania and the marginal seats of New South Wales. Published polls have Labor comfortably ahead, but no one believes them. Insiders believe the contest is close, and sentiment is different in different parts of the country. Morrison is battling cross currents. He orbits between a political opponent who, mostly, maintains strategic ambiguity and declines to rise to the prime minister\u2019s bait; colleagues fretting about cashed up independents marshalling in Liberal heartland; the small but roiling chunk of the electorate ropable about the creep of government during the pandemic; and Labor premiers, who may or may not be helpful to him. Not just Labor premiers, actually \u2013 the newly installed Dominic Perrottet shows little appetite for sucking up. The choppy dynamics make it difficult for Morrison to do what he does best \u2013 find a cut-through line, or land a knockout blow. Morrison escaped from the absolute shemozzle of the final parliamentary sitting fortnight and hit the pre-Christmas hustings without a particularly clear message. Over this past week I\u2019ve had time to go back and review the campaign Morrison ran in 2019. There was next to no policy, and only one message \u2013 Bill Shorten is the bill you can\u2019t afford. Strikingly simple. And effective. Morrison\u2019s problem is he can\u2019t rinse and repeat. He\u2019s not the new bloke. He\u2019s been prime minister for a term and a bit. Morrison is weighted by incumbency and the negatives that accumulate inexorably in the process of creating a record. Some basic metrics tell the story. If we look at our Guardian Essential poll, Morrison\u2019s approval has slipped from a high of 65% in mid February to 48% in November. Disapproval has ticked up from 28% to 42%.   Related: Gladys for Warringah is the latest salvo in Morrison\u2019s war against an integrity commission | Katharine Murphy    If we look at the gender split, Morrison is not tracking well with women under the age of 55. The prime minister\u2019s low ebb with women was the catastrophic summer bushfires in 2019-20, when his approval languished on 35%. He recovered through 2020. But then Brittany Higgins turned the tables. Morrison\u2019s tone deaf and periodically aggressive mishandling of parliament\u2019s #MeToo reckoning prompted another plunge in approval, from 65% of women in the sample to 46%. Morrison rallied and recovered again, but there\u2019s been a second slide since October. The prime minister ends 2021 on 42% (50% of men in the sample approve of his performance). The downside of incumbency is people get to know you. Once negative impressions form, they can be hard to shift. Incumbency has pluses of course. Incumbents have control over election timing, and generally, uncertain environments are beneficial because some voters prefer to stick with leaders they know. But if you\u2019ve listened closely to Morrison\u2019s messaging on the hustings over the past couple of weeks, the prime minister is an incumbent who thinks voters either don\u2019t care, or have forgotten any positives the government delivered during the pandemic.   Sign up for the Guardian Australia's Weekend App   When he\u2019s not trialling new made-for-TV grabs (a new \u201cshake and bake\u201d analogy, which I think was invoked first in relation to emissions reduction, and now has morphed into something broadly economy adjacent, or \u201cjabs and jobs\u201d which was Friday\u2019s innovation), the prime minister has taken to listing things. Morrison\u2019s current list includes saving lives during the pandemic. Shoring up the health system \u201cwith more than $33bn from the federal government in additional investment\u201d. Saving livelihoods with \u201cthe single largest economic rescue package in our history\u201d. Presiding over economic recovery after the waves of the pandemic \u2013 \u201cmore than 350,000 jobs created in a five-week period after the lockdowns were lifted, and through the crisis, we have maintained that AAA credit rating\u201d. At the risk of stating the obvious, prime ministers don\u2019t have to list their achievements if they are confident voters have already logged them. Morrison\u2019s list invites any disaffected voters to consider the counterfactual \u2013 the universe where coronavirus ran rampant through an unvaccinated population, the health system collapsed, and businesses were left to fend for themselves. But voters generally don\u2019t thank leaders for alternate scenarios they haven\u2019t experienced, as Labor found when it imagined voters might reward the government for sparing Australians a recession during the global financial crisis.    If that happens, Morrison transits from being the solution \u2013 Mr Miracle, the election winner \u2013 to being the problem.    The other inherent problem with pandemic humblebrag is the public health risks are ongoing. The Omicron variant is evidently highly infectious. This pandemic is not (as Morrison would put it) in the rear-vision mirror. Voters will judge his competence in real time. If the risks are well managed at the time Australians go to the polls, that\u2019s one thing. If they are not, that\u2019s quite another. As we stagger towards the summer, Liberals say things aren\u2019t great in New South Wales. The government wants to pick up three seats in Morrison\u2019s home state. Some people report the prime minister is currently a drag on the brand in the state polling. This could be malicious scuttlebutt of course \u2013 colleagues who don\u2019t like Morrison really don\u2019t like him. Insiders love to gossip about party polling but very few people actually see it. But there was a striking ratio in Thursday\u2019s mid-year economic and fiscal outlook \u2013 $908m of a $2.3bn infrastructure spend was directed to regional and marginal seats in New South Wales. And while the independents phenomenon, nationally, is more likely to be noise than revolution, the Liberals are clearly worried about Wentworth. For city Liberals digging in to repel the insurgent independents, the persistent disaffection with Morrison among younger female voters must be weight in their saddle bags. During the political lows of 2021, Morrison has counselled his colleagues to hold their nerve, and rally behind him, because when the existential moment arrives, he will find the pathway to victory. The prime minister\u2019s homily was and is simple: I won in 2019 when none of you thought I would, and if you shut up and let me lead, I will win in 2022. You need me to win, in other words. I\u2019m the magic. Morrison\u2019s \u201cleave it to me boys\u201d mantra is buttressed by present electoral reality. In the absence of a big It\u2019s Time-style swing, Labor will struggle to win the number of seats it needs to form government. Albanese could secure a positive swing of 5% in Queensland and still wash out of the contest with the same number of seats because of the big margins Coalition MPs accrued in 2019. It\u2019s really tough. Morrison\u2019s calculating political brain is formidable, and he will spend whatever down time he gets over the summer stitching his campaign messaging together. Colleagues will hope some of the accumulated negative sentiment around Morrison washes through over the summer; that voters will be more inclined to see their prime minister as an experienced leader who can engineer Australia\u2019s economic recovery rather than a ruthless politician prone to shameless pork-barrelling and habitual lying.    As we end this brutal political year, there\u2019s plenty of next generation positioning in evidence in the Liberal party \u2013 an active shadow contest between busy Josh Frydenberg and bolshie Peter Dutton. But there are no signs of panic in government ranks. The downside risk for Morrison is a wet summer doesn\u2019t wash away his negatives, and the prime minister continues to corrode in the court of public opinion as the new political year opens. If that happens, Morrison transits from being the solution, the magic, the verified election winner, Mr Miracle \u2013 to being the problem, the barrier to entry. I have no idea if that point will be reached. Honestly, it seems unlikely on the balance of probabilities. But not impossible. Once upon a time, the Liberal party was too sentimental to move against a prime minister who had become a drag on the brand. (Ask Peter Costello.) But the Liberal party of contemporary times is as ruthless as a gang of end-of-lease cleaners. (Ask Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull.) If a leader outlives his political usefulness, we\u2019ve seen the exactly the same formula applied before the last two federal elections \u2013 reset by switching the frontman, deliver a budget, pin your ears back and race to the polls.", "\u2018There is a lot of distrust\u2019: why women in their 30s are hesitant about the Covid vaccine [2021-01-30T19:00:17Z]": "When the Australian government launched its $24m Covid-19 vaccine information campaign this week, key among the primary targets were women aged 30-39, who were found to be the most vaccine-hesitant group in the Australian population by health department research. Similar patterns of vaccine hesitancy among women have been found globally. So the question on everybody\u2019s lips is: what\u2019s driving it? The answer is we don\u2019t know, because we haven\u2019t asked.  Many reports have worried that vaccine hesitancy is being fuelled by the burgeoning wellness culture, but Dr Kate Young, a research fellow at the Queensland University of Technology\u2019s Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, told the Guardian that\u2019s not the whole story.    Young said we won\u2019t have any luck convincing this vaccine-hesitant group to get the jab unless we know exactly what their concerns are.  \u201cWe\u2019ve all just decided to prescribe these reasons to women as to why they are not getting vaccinated \u2013 people say it\u2019s the wellness community, it\u2019s because they do yoga and like to look at Instagram,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t actually know because no one has done the research.\u201d Young hits upon a refrain that we hear far too often in women\u2019s health: \u201cWe just don\u2019t know.\u201d Or perhaps more accurately, we just don\u2019t care to know. But experts working in the area have their own theories, and wellness influencers aren\u2019t on the top of the list.   Related: Covid vaccine ad campaign aims to reassure Australians about safety and efficacy of jabs    Pregnant women and the vaccine unknown First, the vaccine-hesitant population overlaps with another social group we don\u2019t care to know very much about. There is one reason that all the experts interviewed for this story said is being overlooked in this conversation: women aged 30-39 in Australia are the group most likely to be pregnant, breastfeeding or raising a young family. \u201cWhat are most women in that age group in Australia doing? They are having babies,\u201d Young said. The Australian Bureau of Statistics currently puts the average childbearing age in Australia at 30.7 years, and the Australian Institute of Family Studies found that in 2020, a woman\u2019s late 20s and early 30s are the most common age for her to become a new mother. Dr Naomi Smith, a lecturer in sociology at the Federation University Australia who has published research on anti-vaccination beliefs in Australia, said this notion chimes with her research suggesting that vaccine hesitancy is highly feminised because the responsibility for healthcare is highly feminised. The vaccine-hesitant movement is \u201cconnected to mothering and the responsibility women carry for the health of their children, particularly in the early years,\u201d she said. And when it comes to why women who are thinking about parenting are cautious about getting the vaccine, Young said the reasons are pretty clear. \u201cThe World Health Organization has recommended that pregnant women do not get the [Pfizer] vaccine because it hasn\u2019t been tested on pregnant women,\u201d she said. On Tuesday, the Royal Australia and New Zealand College for Obstetricians and Gynaecologists issued similar advice, saying it did not recommend the Covid-19 vaccine for pregnant women due to a lack of safety data.    A history of exclusion A recent study in the medical journal Lancet found that three-quarters of trials for any of the Covid-19 treatments or vaccines have explicitly excluded pregnant women. This is despite the fact we know that pregnant women who contract Covid-19 are more likely to end up in intensive care than other patients. A review of the trials found the scientists did not provide reasons for the exclusion of pregnant women. Concerns about the dangers of including pregnant women in clinical trials are understandable. As one study noted, \u201cMany substances, including medications, can cross the placenta and potentially irreversibly affect foetal growth, structure, or function, there might be significant risk of harm to the unborn baby.\u201d   Related: The female problem: how male bias in medical trials ruined women's health    The physiological changes that take place during pregnancy can also mean researchers cannot be sure how different drugs will interact with women\u2019s bodies. But according to Dr Loulou Kobeissi, a scientist at the World Health Organization, these reasons do not apply to the majority of Covid-19 vaccine and treatment trials. \u201cThe systematic exclusion of pregnant women cannot be justified on the basis of safety as many of the medications being evaluated are either not harmful in pregnancy, or their risks are minimal,\u201d she said. Because pregnant women were banned from participating in trials following the thalidomide scandal of the 1960s \u2013 a decision only overturned in 2019 \u2013 we just don\u2019t know what the effects of the vaccine might be for mothers or foetuses. Without any evidence, mothers or would-be mothers are unsure about whether to get the jab.    Another reason for women being more vaccine hesitant is the lack of knowledge about their bodies \u2013 because the exclusion from scientific testing historically does not stop at pregnant women. It extends to all women. The majority of all scientific and medical testing is conducted on male bodies, animals and cells.   Related: Air grievances: silence swirls around the toll of bushfire smoke during pregnancy    Researchers at the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston said in a 2014 report that medical science \u201croutinely fails\u201d to include women in clinical trials and at all stages of medical research. A 2016 report in Pharmacy Practice cited evidence that historically medicine has failed to adequately enrol women in scientific studies and these deficiencies \u201chave hindered the progress of understanding women\u2019s response to medications\u201d. Until just 25 years ago, all women of reproductive age were routinely excluded from medical studies, with scientists assuming the results of testing on men\u2019s bodies would apply equally to women. And so this story comes back to one that we have heard more and more about recently, but not in the context of vaccine hesitancy: we simply don\u2019t know enough about how women\u2019s bodies work.  A matter of trust This knowledge gap in medicine when it comes to women\u2019s bodies is also part of a larger story. There\u2019s a trust gap, too. The fact doctors have always known little about women\u2019s biology has meant women are much more likely than men to have had negative experiences with the healthcare system. That means they are more likely to feel distrustful of doctors, Dr Naomi Smith said. \u201cWe know from previous research that women are less likely to be believed by doctors about pain and chronic conditions,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWomen are under-diagnosed or treated for psychological problems instead of their physical symptoms.    Women do often have lower levels of trust in the medical establishment, because they are not taken seriously.  Dr Naomi Smith     \u201cIn a system that can often be hostile to women and their health needs, women do often have lower levels of trust in the medical establishment, because they are not taken seriously.\u201d Smith\u2019s point is borne out again and again in research literature. Endometriosis, a disease in which cells that are similar to those that line the uterus, called endometrial cells, start to grow all over the body, is an oft-cited example. The errant tissue and cells can cause pain, internal adhesions, bleeding, gastrointestinal problems, fatigue, and a litany of other symptoms depending on where in the body the disease takes hold. But the condition is poorly understood and, as a result, poorly treated. It has long been dismissed as \u201cbad period pain\u201d, and doctors are only now discovering that it is a whole-of-system disease with far-reaching consequences. Studies show that women\u2019s distrust in medicine also increases when they have other gynaecology-specific health problems such as polycystic ovary syndrome. Many other chronic pain conditions that primarily affect women, including lupus, migraines, fibromyalgia and fibroids, are similarly under-diagnosed and under-treated. Lupus is a serious autoimmune disease whose sufferers are 90% women, and which most often occurs in women of childbearing age. But we know very little about it, and as a result 66% of people diagnosed with the condition said they had previously been misdiagnosed. In fact, 40% of all women diagnosed with any serious autoimmune disease had previously been told by doctors there was nothing wrong or were accused of being hypochondriacs.    Young said the knowledge that medical science does not necessarily know what is best for women and their bodies is something women metabolise early on and could be a major factor contributing to vaccine hesitancy among this population. \u201cWomen know they are not being included,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you take an average woman on the street, she might not know about the number of women in research studies but it\u2019s something that you grow up with, when you go to your GP again and again and they just don\u2019t get it, and you are dismissed again and again. \u201cThere is a lot of distrust in the system among women. Historically, we have earned that distrust.\u201d By failing to include women in scientific research, the medical establishment also continues to mistreat and misdiagnose disorders in women\u2019s bodies that they know too little about, which further engenders distrust in the system, which may make these people susceptible to messaging that places doubt on medical authorities. It\u2019s cyclical and self-reinforcing. Acknowledging the complex reasons for vaccine hesitancy is critical to fighting coronavirus. That means we need to ask women what their concerns are, and be willing to listen if the answer is that it\u2019s difficult to trust a system that has excluded and damaged them \u2013 over and over again.", "Morning mail: Djokovic leaves, WA locks out doctors, Australia\u2019s Ashes victory [2022-01-16T19:49:19Z]": "Good morning.

The delegates are working on the details now. We\u2019ll bring you all the updates of that, and more, as the day rolls on. So we will see you back here at 10ish if Labor conference is your bag. It\u2019s been lovely hanging with you today \u2013 hope you have a lovely night, and please \u2013 take care of you.     Updated at 7.59am BST     7.51am BST       Essentially \u2013 peace in our time. Or as close as the Labor party and its many, many factions can get.     Updated at 7.53am BST     7.50am BST    Conference heads off union fight on trade agreements    OK, so that all got a little confusing there for a moment \u2013 which is the problem with watching something from another state.  So, basically, the big union fight with the free trade agreements was nullified with the conference delegates overwhelmingly voting to get rid of paragraph 12 of the draft policy platform and replace it with two other paragraphs. That is this amendment (the crossed out bit is the original one): Amendment Remove existing paragraph 12 and replace with two new paragraphs (to be inserted as paragraphs 9 and 10 as a result of the renumbering in the previous amendment): Paragraph 12: 12.  Labor believes that the process of developing, negotiating and finalising trade agreements should be transparent, consultative and subject to the processes of the parliament. However, under the current framework, trade agreements are the prerogative of executive government, and the parliament usually only determines enabling legislation. Labor in opposition will challenge agreements that do not meet the above criteria, but may vote for, or against enabling legislation.  9. Labor believes that the process of developing, negotiating and finalising trade agreements should be transparent, consultative and subject to the processes of the parliament. However, under the current framework, trade agreements are the prerogative of executive government, and the parliament only determines enabling legislation designed to give effect to certain limited provisions of the agreement. 10. Labor in opposition will: (a) Seek written confirmation from the government that any trade agreement signed by the government does not violate clauses 7 and 8; (b) Undertake formal consultation with affected unions about the impact of any proposed trade agreement; (c) Labor will actively campaign against trade agreements that do not comply with clauses 7 or 8 above, including by making shadow ministerial statements, participating in public campaigns, demanding that the commonwealth conduct rigorous independent economic analysis and debating the merits of the agreement in the parliament and parliamentary committees. (d) Amend parliamentary procedures to require an independent economic assessment of the impact of each agreement to be included in the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties to the parliament; and (e) Vote against any enabling legislation for agreements, where the enabling legislation itself does not comply with clauses 7 or 8 above. 11. If prior to the election of a Labor government, trade agreements are signed which are not consistent with the above, Labor in government will seek the renegotiation of the agreement to ensure it is consistent with the above points before bringing any enabling legislation before the parliament. So because that was passed by practically all but 30-something delegates, the further amendment the ETU and construction union wanted was deemed irrelevant \u2013 it was inconsistent with what the overwhelming will of the conference had just voted for.    Updated at 7.57am BST     7.44am BST       There is an evening session, from about 7.30pm, but it is basically people in their PJs sitting at home, listening to Labor\u2019s true believers give speeches.     Updated at 7.57am BST     7.30am BST       Here was Penny Wong on the foreign affairs platform:  I think our relationship with China is one we have to approach with discipline, with a great clarity about our national interest; with a willingness to recognise where we can engage but also where we will have differences. And I think this platform recognises that we will never walk away from those issues where it is clearly in Australia\u2019s national interest to keep prosecuting, whether it\u2019s on the South China Sea, on the principles of international law \u2013 which are reflected in the platform \u2013 whether they are on human rights or the Law of the Sea. These are matters in our national interest. We also recognise the importance of continuing to engage with China notwithstanding those differences and the approach the Australian Labor party will take were we elected is one that would be characterised by maturity and by discipline.  And on Palestine:   Look, there\u2019s been a lot written and a bit said about this provision for platform and I want to make this crystal clear. The platform now reflects precisely the same position as the Labor party national conference reached under Bill Shorten in 2018. There\u2019s no lesser or greater weight and the position is replicated. It is a position which recognises the views of the conference in relation to statehood. It\u2019s a position which recognises that any such decision would be made by a future Labor government. And it\u2019s a position which reinforces our collective commitment to a just and fair two-state solution.  And on Labor not using the term \u2018genocide\u2019 in its resolution on Uighurs:   I recognise that that is an assessment some parliaments have made. Obviously, one of the answers in Senate estimates was \u201cthat\u2019s a matter for international tribunals\u201d. I think what is more important though is for us to say this: these are systemic and serious violations of human rights and they are not the actions of a responsible global power. And we would say to the Chinese government: having great power, with that comes some great responsibilities, including to respect the human rights provisions to which you have previously committed.     Updated at 7.37am BST     7.27am BST       So the paragraph 12 amendment passed \u2013 emphatically. The ETU amendment has not been supported - it is inconsistent with the amendment which was passed. So basically, the amendment which passed cancels the ETU vote out.  So there is still a fight to be had there. It means there will be a lot of back and forth tonight over it \u2013 which continues the fight the unions have wanted for the last five years or so, for another conference. But as far as the platform is concerned, the issue is settled. (rumble behind the scenes, but in public, the delegates have agreed) There are no absolute majorities in this conference (in terms of the faction numbers), which make the disputed votes very difficult, if unions dig in. The ETU and the construction union rolled the dice - but the conference has decided their amendment isn\u2019t needed.  The conference has adjourned until tomorrow.    Updated at 7.43am BST     7.18am BST       While we wait for the vote outcome, Sarah Martin has written up on this fight earlier:   Related: Labor headed for a showdown over free trade agreements      Updated at 7.21am BST     7.11am BST       The electronic voting is still going on.        6.55am BST       Peter Ong from the Queensland Electrical Trades Union wants this bit added to the trade resolution: Add the following after paragraph 10 in the statement in detail on trade: 10. Labor in opposition will oppose any enabling legislation for agreements, where that agreement does not comply with paragraphs 7, 8 and 9, or if that agreement would have the effect of not complying with those paragraphs through the conferral of most favoured nation status. Basically, Ong doesn\u2019t want Labor speaking out against free trade agreements that don\u2019t meet the members\u2019 resolutions in public, but then supporting it in private (ie when it comes to legislation/negotiations).    Updated at 7.01am BST     6.52am BST       I have been laughing at the last image, of the prime minister and the governor general standing next to a Zoom screen, for the past five minutes. Your week might be bad, but is it \u2018we have sworn in our new cabinet over teleconference and then had to pose with a screen like everything is totally normal for an official photograph\u2019 bad?    It is with a great sense of honour and responsibility to become the first Women\u2019s Safety Minister. Sadly violence against women and their children remains an unacceptable scourge in Australia and I believe this is an opportunity to put policies in place that say enough is enough. pic.twitter.com/JzpLeulswX&mdash; Anne Ruston (@Anne_Ruston) March 30, 2021      Updated at 6.55am BST     6.50am BST       There has been a lot of angst over Labor\u2019s support of free trade agreements in the past. This resolution is aimed at making sure everyone is on the same page, for when the next one comes up.        6.49am BST       So the crossed out parts there are what the original paragraph says, and what is being crossed out.        6.47am BST       Here are the agreed changes in fair trade negotiations: Amendment Remove existing paragraph 12 and replace with two new paragraphs (to be inserted as paragraphs 9 and 10 as a result of the renumbering in the previous amendment): Paragraph 12: 12.  Labor believes that the process of developing, negotiating and finalising trade agreements should be transparent, consultative and subject to the processes of the parliament.

Updated at 6.51am BST     6.40am BST       Justine Keay, who lost the Tasmanian seat of Braddon at the last election, has written a piece on why marginal seats matter, and why Labor\u2019s platform needs to take that into account.    Updated at 6.46am BST     6.35am BST       Matt Burnett, the wildly popular mayor of Gladstone in central Queensland (and who Labor wants to take on Ken O\u2019Dowd in Flynn) has moved a motion to have local councils included back on national cabinet. Councils were part of Coag. But they have been left out of national cabinet. Burnett says it\u2019s not much to ask that the 537 local councils across Australia have one seat at the national cabinet table. Labor agrees.        6.28am BST    Labor wants northern Australia construction, tourism and hospitality support    We\u2019ve moved on to northern Australia \u2013 everyone wants more support for northern Australia, something the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility was supposed to do, but hasn\u2019t really achieved in its seven or so years of existence.  Labor wants construction, tourism and hospitality also supported in those areas, rather than just a focus on bigger industries and projects. Cathy O\u2019Toole, the former member for Herbert, makes an appearance here.    Updated at 6.45am BST     6.23am BST       Paddy Crumlin, speaking on the seafarers\u2019 amendment, gets about three \u2018delegate wind-ups\u2019 but he doesn\u2019t get muted. It\u2019s a very congenial conference.    Updated at 6.27am BST     6.13am BST       Very quick work from Jim Chalmers\u2019 staff here.

Major union breaks away from NSW Labor over poor performance | @AlexSmithSMH https://t.co/cnyMXF0arc&mdash; The Sydney Morning Herald (@smh) March 30, 2021      Updated at 6.10am BST     6.01am BST       In this chapter, it\u2019s all about industry, construction and manufacturing \u2013 these are also agreed upon \u2013 the amendments are about making the policy platform clearer: For example, on manufacturing:  Labor will employ a variety of means to provide a stronger future for Australian manufacturing.  These measures will include: a. supporting the transition to modern clean forms of energy to deliver affordable, reliable and increasingly clean energy to Australian industry, while recognising the special requirements of energy-intensive forms of heavy manufacturing; b. delivering high-quality skills and training for manufacturing workers through enhanced and secure funding for Tafe and universities through Jobs and Skills Australia; c. the continuing use of taxation measures to foster research and development and investment in new plant and equipment; d. procurement policies; e. supporting specific policy interventions to grow our domestic supply chain and assist small businesses to become medium and large businesses; f. fostering collaboration between industry, unions and research institutions through industry innovation councils; and g. supporting Buy Australia programs.   The original paragraph read: Labor will employ a variety of means to provide a stronger future for Australian manufacturing. These measures will include:  supporting the transition to modern clean forms of energy to deliver affordable, reliable and increasingly clean energy to Australian industry; the continuing use of research and development tax incentives; procurement policies; fostering collaboration between industries and research institutions; and supporting Buy Australia programs.

He was meant to be doing it from Maryborough \u2013 where the trains Campbell Newman\u2019s government ordered from India are being fixed (they didn\u2019t fit the tracks) \u2013 but he is in lockdown in Brisbane. Speaking of that lockdown, another case looks like it has been diagnosed in Bundaberg, which means Queensland is facing an extended lockdown (beyond the three days first slated). I am so sorry, Queensland. I\u2019m keeping it all crossed for you.     Updated at 6.15am BST     5.53am BST       The audio was really terrible for the Kristina Keneally and Penny Wong press conference, so we are chasing those questions and will bring you those answers when we can.      Updated at 6.19am BST     5.52am BST       The ads are back on the Labor conference stream \u2013 which means we are back on deck.    Updated at 5.55am BST     5.36am BST       Scott Morrison\u2019s Twitter account has not tweeted about the new cabinet now being sworn in \u2013 the most recent tweet is:    Over 69,000 disaster payments have now been paid out by our Government to support Australians impacted by the floods, totalling $86.9 million. In most cases these payments of $1000 for adults and $400 for children have been paid within an hour.

We\u2019ll listen in for you.        4.58am BST       The conference is now on break until 3.30. So it is time for the ads again. Scott Morrison isn\u2019t listening. That is pretty much the Labor election campaign right there.        4.57am BST       That whole chapter has been carried. The debate around some of those resolutions was INTENSE, according to some of the delegates. It always is. But it also says something about the focus this time around that the fights have been carried out off-campus. Partly that is down to having a slimmed-down platform. But it is also because Labor is staring down the barrel of more than a decade in opposition if it loses this next election, and that has a way of bringing even lifelong combatants together.       Updated at 5.10am BST     4.54am BST       Labor has also resolved to recognise Palestine as its own state: The Special Platform Conference  supports the recognition and right of Israel and Palestine to exist as two states within secure and recognised borders; calls on the next Labor government to recognise Palestine as a state; and expects that this issue will be an important priority for the next Labor government.     Updated at 5.01am BST     4.54am BST       Another interesting resolution in this chapter \u2013 Labor once again cares about the impact of national security incursions. That\u2019s nice.   Labor will always work responsibly and constructively to improve our national security laws and to ensure our security agencies and police can employ the powers they already have, and can acquire such additional powers they may need to meet the changing national security threats we face as a nation. Labor will ensure those powers are consistent with the long-standing values and hard-won liberties that help to define Australia as a democratic nation that always upholds the freedom and privacy of its citizens. Labor will enhance existing mechanisms to ensure parliamentary and statutory oversight of intelligence agencies is commensurate with their increasing responsibilities and powers. Powers exercised by security agencies which impinge on the fundamental rights of citizens should wherever possible be authorised by warrant and reviewable by a court.     Updated at 4.59am BST     4.53am BST       Kimberley Kitching is moving the chapter\u2019s amendments, but we heard from the seconder, Janelle Saffin first, as Kitching wasn\u2019t on the line. Kitching is back now, and talking about what the Uighur communities are going through in China. Here is that resolution:  National Conference:  Strongly condemns the human rights violations against the Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minorities in Xinjiang and across China. Notes:  that there is a growing number of reports of the mass arbitrary detention of China\u2019s minority Uyghur population and other violations of human rights including forced labour, forced sterilisation, sexual assault and restriction of movement in Xinjiang and across China. These are not the actions of a responsible global power. that China is a state party to the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  Urges the Chinese government to uphold its international human rights obligations in Xinjiang and across China and allow unfettered access to Xinjiang by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Notes that the US government and the Parliaments of Canada and the Netherlands have labelled the human rights violations in Xinjiang as genocide, and that Human Rights Watch has labelled them as crimes against humanity.  A future Labor government will ensure that Australia stands up for human rights in China and work with the international community to hold China to account for its international commitments. Calls on the Australian government to:  provide its assessment of what is happening in Xinjiang and how it characterises the human rights violations that are taking place \u2013 based on all of the information available to its agencies. explain what actions it is taking to address the situation in Xinjiang and to provide support to Uyghur communities in Australia.      Updated at 4.58am BST     4.50am BST       There are about 35 amendments in this chapter \u2013 they are all agreed though, so all that work has been done behind the scenes ahead of the conference. If you look at the amendments, you can see some of that work \u2013 bits have been crossed out \u2013 it\u2019s just a few words, but it matters in this stuff. For example, in one of the climate change amendments, the word \u2018objective\u2019 has been crossed out, meaning that the delegates wanted it stronger \u2013 not an objective, but a stated fact. That Amendment 071A to Chapter 7 to the introduction to Paragraph 44 be modified to read: Labor believes that working to ensure global action on climate change and the protection of the global environment  is a vital foreign policy   objective should be a  new pillar  core objective of Australia\u2019s foreign policy. Climate change represents an existential threat to humanity and is the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples in the Pacific. Environmental degradation contributes to social and political conflict and undermines regional and international security. Labor will lead in multilateral forums to achieve global action on climate change, environmental protection and sustainable development. Ensuring traditional owners as well as the entire community are included in program design and implementation will be a priority. Labor will:  support implementation of the Paris Accord, with the goal of limiting global warming to less than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels and taking efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels and be an active participant in the UNFCCC; work to further strengthen the Antarctic Treaty System with particular emphasis on enhancing environmental protection; drive diplomatic engagement with like-minded nations on international instruments to better protect the world\u2019s oceans; and work through international forums to address unsustainable fishing practices worldwide with the establishment of protected areas a particular priority. We will energetically seek to combat unsustainable, illegal and unregulated fishing in the Southern Ocean and work to strengthen the law of the sea to improve sustainable ocean management.     Updated at 4.55am BST     4.46am BST       Delegate Nizza Siano has put forward this one:  Labor\u2019s policy should be framed to provide a positive and compassionate approach by a Labor government to the treatment of refugees, rather than a reaction to the punitive and cruel approach of the Coalition government. Refugees and those seeking asylum in Australia are to be welcomed under a Labor government as assets who enhance this nation and our economy and provide positive contribution to our strong multicultural society.     Updated at 4.53am BST     4.45am BST       In this chapter, Michael Danby will move this motion:  Labor calls on China to abide by its own constitution and laws, which expressly allows for the cultural autonomy of the Tibetan people within the People\u2019s Republic. Tibetans must be allowed, as they are under Chinese law, to freely practice their religion, to learn and speak their language and to have official documents in the language of the vast majority of people living in the Tibetan autonomous zone.     Updated at 4.51am BST     4.45am BST       Penny Wong:  Our world is being reshaped and Australia has to work harder to secure our interests.  We have to act to shape the world in the region \u2013 we want one that not only respects sovereignty, but is stable and prosperous.  We have to return to our leadership role, being the partner of choice in our region and helping our neighbours, but we have a prime minister who only governs for himself, and who puts his own domestic political interests ahead of the national interest, who is mired in political crisis.  He makes the biggest government spend in Australian history on defence equipment, but hasn\u2019t delivered on our security requirements and hasn\u2019t increased our home-grown defence industry capability. A prime minister who talks tough on China, but has overseen Australia becoming even more dependent on China for our exports, and who leaves that hundreds of thousands of Australians whose jobs depend on trade and whose ministers blame farmers for their exports not making it to market.  Brendan O\u2019Connor seconds this motion.     Updated at 4.50am BST     4.42am BST       Penny Wong introduces this one.  She is at the conference (in Bankstown) so there is no video here.      Updated at 4.47am BST     4.41am BST       All those amendments have been carried \u2013 there was no disagreement there \u2013 or surprises. (It\u2019s about improving the justice system, and access to justice). So we move on to chapter seven \u2013 Australia\u2019s place in the world. This is about foreign affairs. The main issue was with China \u2013 that has mostly been worked out, I hear. But still, always worth watching.     Updated at 4.43am BST     4.34am BST       We are motoring through these amendments \u2013 most of the delegates seem to have waived their right to speak. That\u2019s what happens when everyone agrees \u2013 you don\u2019t have anyone left to convince.     Updated at 4.38am BST     4.30am BST       This chapter is about services, treatment and the justice system.    Updated at 4.32am BST     4.21am BST       All of those amendments have come through \u2013 so we are now at strengthening Australia\u2019s democracy. Kristina Keneally is introducing the chapter from \u201cregional Australia\u201d \u2013 outside the North Sydney olympic pool which received a $10m regional Australia grant for upgrades. It\u2019s all part of a bit meant to highlight the scandals of the Morrison government\u2019s spending.   In the years since Scott Morrison made that announcement, the need for an integrity commission has only grown stronger. Integrity in politics matters. It matters to the health and strength of our democracy. But how can Scott Morrison look after you, how can he look after our jobs, prosperity and democracy, when he is so busy looking after himself? Australians deserve a government that is on their side. Anthony Albanese and Labor will deliver a national integrity commission, a federal anti-corruption body, powerful, transparent and independent. Labor will fight for transparency and integrity in government. And that\u2019s why, today, I\u2019m proud to move chapter six of this conference \u2013 Strengthening Australian Democracy. I welcome the support of delegates and look forward to a spirited debate on how Labor can bring accountability to the Australian people.     Updated at 4.46am BST     4.11am BST       So far, the amendments we have seen as part of the Labor conference are all part of the areas most of Labor (give or take a line or two) agree on.  One of the sessions where a little more fire is expected is coming up in chapter seven \u2013 Australia\u2019s Place in the World. That\u2019s about foreign affairs and relations, including China.     Updated at 4.29am BST     4.07am BST       All the ministers are being sworn in remotely. They then have to hold up and show the governor general their signed statement, like they are waving a participation award around at assembly. Christin Porter is now being sworn in. He is back in his office \u2013 today is his first day back at work.       Updated at 5.07am BST     4.04am BST    Scott Morrison's new cabinet sworn in    The new cabinet is being sworn in.

Updated at 5.13am BST     4.01am BST       It is back to gender equality and women\u2019s safety, including unpaid care work and other issues that impact women. These amendments all have support (as you would expect).    Updated at 4.07am BST     4.01am BST       And after a quick sojourn into another amendment, on women\u2019s safety, we are back with the Pat Dodson amendment, with Malarndirri McCarthy back on the line.   Yes, I certainly support and endorse the words of my colleagues Linda Burney and Pat Dodson. We are incredibly pleased to be able to come before the national Labor conference in support of improving the lives of First Nations people right across the country.  We certainly want to focus on many things in particular through our First Nations caucus. And also, if I may, acknowledge the Indigenous Labor network members right across the Labor party here in Australia.  We have many things that we wish to work on and we certainly know that improving the lives of First Nations peoples, a critical component of the Labor party\u2019s platform, closing the gap in health, education, but also when you\u2019re living [within the] system.  We have raised concerns, continuously, in terms of the deaths of First Nations people in custody, but also as we come to the 30th anniversary of the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody.  Land, life, culture and kinship is critical to First Nations people, and it\u2019s also critical to embracing a better and holistic relationship between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non-Indigenous Australians.     Updated at 4.10am BST     3.56am BST       Malarndirri McCarthy\u2019s connection has dropped out, so we will return to that one.    Updated at 4.11am BST     3.52am BST       Pat Dodson has the first amendment. He brings up Rio Tinto and Juukan Gorge. His amendment to the platform, seconded by Malarndirri McCarthy is: In recognition of the centrality of land and water to First Nations people\u2019s spirituality, law, culture, economy and wellbeing, Labor supports land rights and Native Title as property rights under Australian law and will work to accelerate the resolution of outstanding land and Native Title claims in partnership with other stakeholders. Labor will work with First Nations people and organisations on reforms to address unfairness in Native Title agreement making.  We believe land use and ownership issues should be resolved by negotiation wherever possible.     Updated at 3.59am BST     3.49am BST       Linda Burney is introducing this chapter:  Opportunity must be more equally shared. We are a better nation because we embrace the diversity of faith, beliefs and world views. We must remain vigilant against racism and extremism, which diminish and divide, friends and delegates. I am proud and thankful for all the work that has gone into this chapter, in particular from the grassroots of our party. This work and amendments are reflected in this chapter.        Updated at 4.12am BST     3.48am BST       The ALP conference is back in session. It is time for chapter 5 \u2013 an equal and inclusive nation.    Updated at 3.49am BST     3.35am BST       While we are waiting for the Labor conference to begin again, this story from the Sydney Morning Herald\u2019s Shane Wright is worth a read, if you haven\u2019t seen it yet:  A pay rise that means a woman earns more than her male partner increases her chance of domestic violence by 35%, ground-breaking Australian research has revealed, suggesting men struggle to deal with not being the family breadwinner. Based on surveys done by the Australian Bureau of Statistics over more than a decade, the same research shows as soon as women earn more than half a couple\u2019s income they face a 20% increase in the chance of suffering from emotional abuse.     Updated at 3.37am BST     3.29am BST       Nope \u2013 we are going back to the conference at 1.40pm.      Updated at 3.49am BST     3.17am BST       The governor general (remember him \u2013 he\u2019s apparently still around, despite not being exactly visible lately) will swear in the new Morrison ministry very soon.    Updated at 3.22am BST     3.17am BST       And here is Mark Butler\u2019s amendments: Move that proposed resolution 168R is amended in the following terms: Labor notes that Australians expect our public health system to provide for their health needs from birth to death. Public health infrastructure, as it exists, has been paid for by taxpayers. The operation of the existing public health system is paid for by taxpayers. Ongoing improvements and expansion of the existing public health system must be paid for by taxpayers.  There is no justi\ufb01cation for supporting a private sector health system with taxpayers\u2019 money when most Australians will not have (nor want) access to it. Labor also notes that private health providers should not be subsidised or supported by the Australian government.  The ALP and a future Labor government will prioritise support for the public health system in all Australian states and territories. A future Labor government will commit to investing Australian taxpayers\u2019 money in public health services that provide equity and access to the Australian people. World-class health services will not be provided by way of extra fees and charges, but as a right as an Australian citizen. The ALP and a future Labor government will have, as a core pillar of its policy and national platform, a commitment to not privatise or outsource public health institutions, jobs, or services. or departments of institutions or services.    The ALP and a future Labor government will not subcontract public health services to private entities unless the contractual arrangements include a guarantee that employees for the private entity will be provided with equal (or better) pay and conditions to those included in the relevant state and territory\u2019s public health system enterprise agreement/s (the industrial instrument that would otherwise apply to employees but for the subcontracting out of services) and their successor documents.     Updated at 3.21am BST     3.15am BST       The amendments are up! Here is what Diana Asmar  put forward: Labor notes that Australians expect our public health system to provide for their health needs from birth to death. Public health infrastructure, as it exists, has been paid for by taxpayers. The operation of the existing public health system is paid for by taxpayers. Ongoing improvements and expansion of the existing public health system must be paid for by taxpayers.

Updated at 3.20am BST     3.09am BST       Let\u2019s take a look at what else is happening in politics, shall we? The Australian Academy of Science has just apologised for sending this tweet after members of the scientific community challenged Christian Porter\u2019s record on his new portfolio:    We thank @karenandrewsmp for her leadership and long-term commitment to science and technology over the past two years.We look forward to working with incoming Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Christian Porter @cporterwa.https://t.co/FifA1baomH&mdash; Australian Academy of Science (@Science_Academy) March 29, 2021    Here is the apology which has just been posted:    Last night we posted a poorly worded tweet about working with the incoming Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. We apologise. We are deeply aware of the challenging circumstances created by the reshuffle. We will always work to advance science in Australia for all.&mdash; Australian Academy of Science (@Science_Academy) March 30, 2021         3.06am BST       Everyone is voting electronically, which is why there is a bit more of a delay in the votes than usual. It looks like Mark Butler will prevail on this one though, which is essentially agreeing with the spirit of the motion (public hospitals should be public) without the wording of the motion (which Butler says would mean public hospitals couldn\u2019t do private procedures, and also, he says, it is mostly a matter for the states). Then we go back to the fun and games at 1.25pm.    Updated at 3.14am BST     2.54am BST       We have finally run out of policy ads.  It is just a blank screen now as the vote is carried out.     Updated at 2.57am BST     2.53am BST       This is a photo taken from Anthony Albanese\u2019s speech just a little while ago, if you needed any indication of how fast the social media team is turning things around today:    Victory over the pandemic, followed by victory for those whose sacrifices made it possible.I am determined to repay our frontline workers \u2013 underpaid and undervalued \u2013 with a better future.Only a Labor Government can make that happen. pic.twitter.com/6CQ5T6Gfud&mdash; Anthony Albanese (@AlboMP) March 30, 2021      Updated at 2.57am BST     2.47am BST       It is very strange hearing the ads as the national conference goes to vote. Usually the stage is just empty. Now we are hearing about the campaigns that some of the unions have run. But in that official \u201cAustralian government\u201d voice.    Updated at 2.57am BST     2.42am BST       While the vote has caused a break in proceedings, we are being shown ads \u2013 for policies. It\u2019s like those Australian government ads you see at the beginning of a movie, about washing your hands or something, but for Labor policies.     Updated at 2.57am BST     2.38am BST    'Our public hospitals should stay public hospitals'    Diana Asmar from the Health Workers Union brings the first non-agreed to motion:  Firstly, it calls on the ALP and a future Labor government to [rule out] privatisation or outsourcing our public health institutions and jobs.  Our public hospitals should stay public hospitals, and secondly, that our future Labor government will not subcontract public health services to the private sector unless it guarantees the pay, conditions and jobs of affected health workers.  There is nothing controversial about these \u2026 yet I note that this motion does not have the typical approval from the relevant Labor shadow minister, in this instance Mark Butler, as much as I tried to reason with his office.  I can only assume that the future Labor government does not want to be bound by these principles.    Butler says while he agrees that public hospitals should stay public, he can\u2019t support the parts of the motion:   But there are a couple of elements of the original motion that\u2019s just been moved by Diana, that I can\u2019t support, for example the sentence that says private health providers will not be supported by Australian governments. With a health system that depends so clearly on private general practitioners\u2019 private conditions, in part, private hospitals and private health insurers, I simply can\u2019t support a statement like that.  He says some of the issues are for the states and territories. Asmar asks for people to support that the public health system should stay public. It moves to a vote.     Updated at 2.57am BST     2.33am BST       We are now moving on to the resolutions which are not agreed upon \u2013 these are the motions which have not been settled beforehand, and there is a bit of fight about them.    Updated at 2.44am BST     2.31am BST       Jason Clare is now talking about social housing as part of the national housing and homelessness plan Labor is endorsing. It has support.     Updated at 2.44am BST     2.29am BST       There is a slight issue where the actual amendments the conference is looking at can\u2019t be seen. I am assured the tech people are on the case.        2.27am BST       The Labor left have put out their magazine this morning \u2013 featuring more young Albo. It\u2019s obviously been timed to coincide with the conference but if you are interested in one of the faction\u2019s takes on everything Labor is looking at, take a look:    Check out the Special Conference Special Challenge in it&#39;s entirety at the link! - https://t.co/NCeR5drajf #ALPConf21 #auspol pic.twitter.com/QwNpYT5M9w&mdash; ChallengeMag (@challengeAU) March 30, 2021      Updated at 2.44am BST     2.21am BST       The first lot of amendments is in and they are on the NDIS \u2013 everyone is in agreement here. The NDIS and aged care need more money is the main agreement.     Updated at 2.26am BST     2.11am BST       Amanda Rishworth is now seconding the motion that Labor endorses a \u201cstrong and healthy society\u201d. One would think that is a given, but you know. It\u2019s their show, so they get to name the things what they want. (It\u2019s basically health and childcare policies.) Right after that, we are going to endorse an \u201cequal and inclusive nation\u201d. Another thing no one is arguing against.     Updated at 2.25am BST     2.06am BST       It\u2019s Mark Butler video time. We are whipping around the country.        2.06am BST       The conference is now seeing a video from Jude, an aged care worker. Jude gets quite upset in the video as she speaks about her job:  The government doesn\u2019t care about me, doesn\u2019t care about the elderly, and it doesn\u2019t give a shit about aged care.  We just need to be respected.  We need to be able to raise our heads and say I\u2019m an aged care worker and I\u2019m proud of what I do.  I\u2019m proud every day that I get to work with these people that are vulnerable \u2013 with more funding, with better funding and with more people coming into the industry and staying in the industry, you know, that, that can be fixed [clicks fingers] like that.  And it\u2019s not happening.  We are a very very special bunch, and we deserve the respect and the pay from the federal government that we need to do our job.      Updated at 2.09am BST     2.03am BST       Everyone agrees to the rules. Wayne Swan is now giving his (remote) address. \u201cLabor is not just a party, it\u2019s a movement,\u201d he says.    Updated at 2.05am BST     1.58am BST       Mich-Elle Myers of the MUA is reading the riot act about how the conference is going to work. Delegates are getting the very strong word they must check the session times. As in \u2013 WE ARE NOT GOING OVER, PEOPLE.    Updated at 2.05am BST     1.56am BST       Wayne Swan, the federal president, is not in Bankstown \u2013 he was meant to be there but the Queensland lockdown has put a kibosh to that. Swan, like most of us, is following along from home.     Updated at 1.57am BST     1.55am BST       And the video is up. It\u2019s as you expected. What ever that means to you    Some people go through life not picking sides.I get that \u2013 but it\u2019s not me.So a long time ago, I did pick a side. Yours. pic.twitter.com/76lBwbbkyX&mdash; Anthony Albanese (@AlboMP) March 30, 2021         1.51am BST       It\u2019s time for the Richard Marles video.  The fun just never stops.        1.47am BST       In case it is not yet clear, the national platform is shaping up to be: Labor will bring the party you need to rebuild, and also we are not Scott Morrison.  That\u2019s pretty much the election campaign right there.    Updated at 1.56am BST     1.47am BST       It\u2019s now Penny Wong\u2019s time on the stage:  Anthony was right when he said Labor values were the right ones for the crisis and they\u2019re the right ones for the recovery in the crisis of a pandemic. It was clear to Australians that we failed or succeeded together. The same realisation that grounds Labor\u2019s project, the same principle that drives Anthony. The pandemic made us see more clearly than ever, the weaknesses in our society and in our economy.       We saw Australia\u2019s most valuable resource \u2013 our people \u2013 were being held back and left behind without thought as to the cost without recognising what that does to the fabric of families and the fabric of our nation, without counting the wealth we would share if everyone had the chance to be their best.  Well, as we emerged from the pandemic, we can\u2019t go back to that. We can\u2019t go back to the real Scott Morrison.     Updated at 1.55am BST     1.42am BST    'After triumph, something better,' Albanese says    Anthony Albanese:  Over more than a century, our policies have evolved, and they\u2019ve modernised with the times. Our cause though, has not changed.  To build our nation and shape it to the benefit of the Australian people, for all our people.  That\u2019s because we understand that no one should be left behind.  And no one held back by a lack of opportunity for a better future.  And no matter what situation Australia is in, no matter what crisis we face, our approach is the same \u2013 we get through it together.  And then plan for a brighter tomorrow.  We\u2019re never satisfied with simply muddling through and returning to how things were. In Australia\u2019s moment of greatest crisis at the height of the second world war, John Curtin led the nation out of military danger then Ben Chifley led into reconstruction.  Their motto \u2013 victory in war and victory in peace.  Remember, victory in war and victory in peace.  After triumph, something better.  And I want those inspiring words to be the theme of this conference, as a new world crisis hopefully nears its end.      Updated at 1.56am BST     1.38am BST       From Anthony Albanese\u2019s video (which includes a lot of photos of young Albo, for those not watching):  Some people go through life, not picking sides, I get that, but it\u2019s not me.  I learned from a young age, watching my mum deal with the health and welfare system that wasn\u2019t always on our side, just how that can hurt people.  So a long long time ago, I did pick a side. I chose to side with those who believed every Australian should have access to health and education, and affordable housing.  I chose to side with working people who wanted to be day\u2019s work for the day\u2019s pay.  I chose to side with NGOs who know the action on climate change is urgent, and economically smart.  I chose a side that believes everyone should have the same opportunities, regardless of their postcode and I\u2019ve spent my life fighting on the side of those Australians.  As a member for Grayndler, and as deputy prime minister, and now as leader of the great Australian Labor party. I did pick a side. Yours.   Bill Shorten: \u201cIntroducing the next prime minister of Australia, Anthony Albanese.\u201d Albanese: \u201cWell, thanks very much, Bill.\u201d    Updated at 1.51am BST     1.34am BST       Bill Shorten is introducing Anthony Albanese.  But first \u2013 it\u2019s time for the video introduction.     Updated at 1.50am BST     1.33am BST       Bill Shorten is speaking about how \u201ceffectively\u201d the Morrison government is in minority \u2013 \u201cone more scandal\u201d away from losing the numbers on the floor.  He mentions \u201cone more backbench troll, sent off to study how to be a human being\u201d before moving on.    Updated at 1.50am BST     1.30am BST       For those looking for the draft national platform, you\u2019ll find it here.    Updated at 1.49am BST     1.29am BST       Bill Shorten is now giving a speech, as the leader who rebuilt the party after the 2013 election loss and brought the party \u201cso close\u201d to winning, twice.        1.29am BST       You are going to hear \u2018On your side\u2019 A LOT in the next couple of days. It is Labor\u2019s slogan for the upcoming election, it\u2019s in every press release, and you may have noticed it is in almost every speech as well.       1.27am BST       The conference opening has been under way \u2013 Linda Burney is speaking about the importance of truth telling.      Updated at 1.47am BST     1.25am BST       You\u2019ll be able to follow along with a live feed of the conference here.    Updated at 1.37am BST     1.24am BST    A conference with a mute button \u2026    The other thing that is very different about this conference is that there is a mute button. So previously, when someone got up to say something which, as Tony Jones used to quip, \u2018We\u2019ll take that as more of a comment,\u2019 people had to listen, until that person was shouted down/supported. Now they can just hit mute. As Jason Clare told Sky this morning:  Reminds me of when I was crook and I had to miss a week from parliament a couple of years ago, and I was sitting in the lounge room. I was able to mute Josh Frydenberg and Scott Morrison when they droned on with those long Dorothy Dixers. So, you can do that. But the whole idea here is to make the party platform shorter and simpler and get us ready for the next election. And hopefully, by doing this online, it\u2019ll mean that a lot of party members and a lot of people that are interested in the development of public policy will be interested in tuning in over the next two days.     Updated at 1.49am BST     1.19am BST       Session one is about to kick off \u2013 and that is when things will start rolling faster on here.    Updated at 1.37am BST     12.43am BST       What\u2019s a policy to keep an eye on?  Anything to do with tax and franking credits. I think we all know there isn\u2019t a lot of time left on those policies.  Vale, franking credits. We barely knew thee.        12.24am BST       For those wondering about one of the policies Anthony Albanese is most excited about, Sarah Martin had a look at the national reconstruction fund:    Related: Cars, trains and ships: Albanese pledges $15bn fund for Australian manufacturing jobs      Updated at 12.37am BST     12.11am BST       One of the policies Labor does want to keep, is the paid parental leave \u2013 at full pay \u2013 for six months (does anyone remember that one?) Anthony Albanese spoke to the Seven Network about why the party wants to keep it in the platform:  This is the same policy in the platform that we had at the last election. It is an aspiration of where we want to go to in the medium term. We will fully cost out that policy and put a time frame on it in government. But we have always said that paid parental leave is so important. For example, if you have six months you could have three months for both parents to have off. And that is a policy that I think will resonate with Australians. We also have a fixed timetable to bring in cheaper childcare for 97% of families. That would kick in from the first of July 2022.     Updated at 12.53am BST     12.11am BST    Good morning    Welcome to coverage of Labor\u2019s national conference. It\u2019s a weird one this year \u2013 we are all remote, watching via screens, which means we won\u2019t have access to where all the actual action happens \u2013 the side rooms and little nooks and crannies, but we will do our best to bring you all the conversations which matter. For those new to Labor conference, it happens once a term, before an election, where the Labor caucus in all its many and varied parts \u2013 grassroots members, unions, MPs and power brokers gather to nut out what Labor\u2019s election policy platform will look like. As the party of the collective, the policies are meant to be a collective undertaking. So here is where the deals are made, the speeches are thrown and the battles are won and lost. Once agreed upon, even those who wanted something different have to swing behind the party\u2019s decision. It\u2019s why you have heard Labor MPs defend some positions that seem counter-intuitive \u2013 the delay in pushing for marriage equality, for one. For the most part, given the year that was and the year that is, most of the decisions seem made. But that doesn\u2019t mean there still won\u2019t be ... discussions. There may not be as many fireworks as usual (I won\u2019t forget one of my first state Labor conferences and the choice words shadow cabinet colleagues were throwing across at each other on the floor) but that doesn\u2019t mean we still won\u2019t see how the sausage is made. It\u2019s not always pretty but it\u2019s important. Labor wants a slimmed-down election platform this year \u2013 so you\u2019re about to learn what policies will be officially dumped. I think most of you can guess what those are, but still. We\u2019ll bring you the ins and outs over the next two days, and we are working the phones to keep you informed of what is happening behind the screens. You\u2019ve got Amy Remeikis on the blog, with Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and Daniel Hurst on the detail.  It\u2019s going to be an ... interesting 48 hours. So grab your coffee and let\u2019s get into it!    Updated at 12.36am BST  ", "Australia is spending billions on the Great Barrier Reef. Will it do any good?  [2022-02-12T19:00:02Z]": "The Great Barrier Reef \u2013 the world\u2019s largest coral reef system, covering an area about the size of Germany \u2013 always comes with big numbers. Last month the Australian government pledged another seemingly large figure, $1bn, for conservation and science to be spent over the next nine years and spread along the 2,300km reef.  That comes on top of state and federal government commitments in the region of $3bn since 2014. So where is all the money going, and will it be enough to keep one of the world\u2019s most complex natural wonders from collapsing under the mounting pressure of global heating?   Related: Scientists dispute Morrison government claim to UN its Great Barrier Reef approach \u2018second to none\u2019    Without rapid global cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, many experts fear the $1bn will do little except delay the inevitable. More urgent for the Morrison government is whether the funding \u2013 contingent on the Coalition winning the next election \u2013 will convince the 21-country world heritage committee not to dump the reef onto its list of sites in danger when it meets in July. The $1bn pledge came just days before a 1 February deadline to deliver a report to the world heritage centre in Paris outlining the health of the reef and what was being done to build its resilience. An economic analysis of the value of the reef \u2013 released in 2017 but still referred to by the government \u2013 said the reef added $6.4bn to the nation\u2019s economy in just one year, mostly through tourism, commercial fishing, recreation and scientific research.    Water quality Some $579.9m of the $1bn pledge would go to water quality projects, with the next largest slice \u2013 $252.9m \u2013 for reef management and conservation. Another $92.7m is for research and adaptation and $74.4m would go to community- and traditional-owner led projects, such as habitat restoration and species protection. The reef\u2019s major threat is from climate change \u2013 specifically, rising ocean temperatures that have caused corals to bleach en masse five times since the first recognised outbreak in 1998. Unesco\u2019s science advisers want management plans to account for the effects of climate change, to have greenhouse gas emissions targets consistent with 1.5C of global warming (analysts say Australia\u2019s approach is aligned with heating closer to 3C) and to do more to cut pollution running into the reef from the land. Sediments, nutrients and pesticides running into the marine park can harm inshore corals, as well as marine habitats such as seagrass meadows and mangroves. One key source for these pollutants is agriculture, both directly when on-farm pollutants get washed into waterways and indirectly when exposed soils and eroded riverbanks are washed away by rain. According to the Queensland government, in the five years from 2017 to 2022, commitments focused on improving water quality stood at $270m from the state government and $396m from the commonwealth. A spokesman for the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said under the $1bn plan, funding for water quality would rise from $60m a year now to $85m a year from 2026-27 through to the end of the decade. The state and federal governments have set targets for water quality up to 2025, and release an annual report card. The most recent results with data up to 2019 show slow progress from previous years, even though three of the four key measures indicate the target is at least halfway to being met. \u201cOverall inshore marine condition remained poor in 2018-2019, with coral and seagrass in poor condition and water quality rated moderate,\u201d the report said. A spokesman for Ley said: \u201cWe are confident that the additional programs generated through this funding will significantly accelerate these outcomes.\u201d Queensland\u2019s minister for the Great Barrier Reef, Meaghan Scanlon, says the $270m in recent years does not include a $2bn renewable energy fund, or $500m for land restoration. \u201cSince 2015, we\u2019ve banned the dumping of dredge spoil, passed tree clearing laws, committed to bring in reef regulations, brought in net free zones and invested billions of dollars to help protect the Great Barrier Reef,\u201d Scanlon says.    Direct intervention Funding for direct interventions to improve water quality is spread across multiple projects. Between 2018 and 2023 some $200m of federal cash is routed through the Great Barrier Reef Foundation (GBRF) \u2013 a small not-for-profit that was given a $443m grant by the Turnbull government in 2018, to be spent over six years. Theresa Fyffe, executive director of projects and partnerships at the foundation, said the bulk of the money had gone to 10 regional programs. Fyffe said the foundation is working with more than 1,000 farmers across 15,000 sq km. There are two approaches, she said. One is to improve the way farmers use fertilisers and pesticides so that less washes away during rain. Field officers work with farmers to map out their land and soil types and document how they use fertilisers and chemicals before drawing up management and monitoring plans. The other identifies projects such as earthworks that will directly tackle problems such as erosion of creek-banks or damage to wetlands. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to drive enduring change,\u201d she said. \u201cWorking with a grower for five years gives you a change that is there forever. That\u2019s when farmers can become advocates.\u201d The grant to the foundation remains controversial. Labor said last month it would terminate the agreement and reallocate any unspent funds if it won the next election. But there is unlikely to be much uncommitted cash left.   Related: Australian government\u2019s plan to protect Great Barrier Reef falls short, environment groups say    The foundation\u2019s managing director, Anna Marsden, said by the end of this financial year, only $80m will be uncommitted and \u201cevery dollar is allocated for a program\u201d with much of the uncommitted funds earmarked for traditional owner-led projects. \u201cWe\u2019re halfway through a job. And it\u2019s a big job,\u201d Marsden said. \u201cThe reef is an extreme sport because there\u2019s opposing views all over the place and everyone is passionate. \u201cBut we can\u2019t give up on the reef. The reef won\u2019t give up and the public aren\u2019t giving up and neither are the scientists. But this is the critical decade. It\u2019s crunch time.\u201d The crown-of-thorns \u2018plague\u2019 In a landmark 2012 scientific paper, scientists at the Australian Institute of Marine Science found coral cover over the reef had dropped by half between 1985 and 2012. About 42% of that loss was down to the voracious coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish (Cots). \u201cThey are just so exquisitely evolved to take advantage of the conditions and they can get to plague proportions,\u201d said Dr Roger Beeden, responsible for co-ordinating the Cots control program and director of reef interventions at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Beedon said Cots are part of the reef\u2019s ecosystem, but they have become a pest that are able to eat their own bodyweight in coral in a matter of days. \u201cThey can cause very rapid decline in coral cover. There can be carpets of them.\u201d The bulk of the funding for the Cots program goes to running five dedicated boats with teams of up to eight divers that select locations based on new methods of modelling outbreaks.    Beeden says since the 2018 funding expanded the program, 268 reefs have been actively managed and 320,000 starfish have been killed in 43,000 diver-hours. Divers use spear-like injection guns to pump the starfish \u2013 which can grow to the size of a dinner plate \u2013 with either ox bile or household vinegar. A new \u201cone shot\u201d method has replaced an older approach that used acid salt that needed to be injected into every arm of the starfish (miss one arm, and the starfish could survive). Beeden said many tourism operators like to carry out their own culling operations as they visit reefs \u201cso we provide them the materials to do that\u201d. The aim for the dive teams, Beeden said, is not to eradicate the starfish, but to get them down to sustainable levels. Divers have become highly skilled, he said, and can spot juvenile starfish the size of a thumbnail. The reef is in the middle of the fourth major outbreak of the starfish since the first in the 1960s. Through the grant to the GBRF, $57m went to controlling Cots, and Beeden said about $41m was spent on the direct control program. Under the latest federal government funding pledge, Beeden said $162m is identified for Cots control. \u201cEvery adult coral we keep alive matters,\u201d he said. \u2018Shuffling the deck chairs\u2019 Some $100m of the GBRF\u2019s grant has gone to research and development projects, adding to funding of reef-related research at other institutions including CSIRO and the Australian Institute of Marine Science. These R&amp;D projects include the development of more heat-tolerant corals, methods to help the dispersal of coral larvae and more controversial approaches such as brightening clouds to shade corals undergoing heat stress.   Related: Great Barrier Reef: cooler weather reduces threat of mass bleaching outbreak this summer    A study released last year suggested if these mostly unproven methods could be deployed at scale, they could slow down the loss of corals by as much as two decades. But scientists agree that any benefits the reef could gain from improving water quality or making corals more resilient will be swamped by rising ocean heat \u2013 an inevitable consequence of increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Two academic experts on reef management and science said the $1bn funding was \u201cnonsensical\u201d because it failed to address the direct cause of the majority of the reef\u2019s problems. \u201cUnless we deal with climate change, everything else is just shuffling the deck chairs,\u201d says Prof Terry Hughes, a prominent coral and reef scientist at James Cook University. \u201cEven if we had pristine water quality and we could find a magical bullet to control crown of thorns, we still have the overwhelming problem of global warming. \u201cThese other Band-Aids will only make a difference if we deal with climate change. They\u2019re all contingent on water temperatures being tolerable for corals.\u201d", "Aged care, women and infrastructure: what to expect from federal budget 2021 [2021-05-10T05:08:00Z]": "Tuesday\u2019s pandemic budget, which the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, insists is not a \u201cspendathon\u201d, will pump billions of dollars into the economy as the government attempts to cement Australia\u2019s economic recovery after last year\u2019s downturn. With Australia\u2019s borders closed for the foreseeable future and the government aiming for an unemployment rate below 5%, the budget will have a focus on stimulating the domestic economy and job creation. The 2021-22 budget has also been put together with an eye to the next election, with a multi-billion-dollar infrastructure package targeting key battleground electorates. The government is also hoping a focus on women will help lift its standing among female voters.   Related: Federal Budget 2021: Coalition to inject more than $4bn into infrastructure projects    So before the big day reveals all, what do we know so far? Aged care Funding for the aged care sector will be the centrepiece of the 2021-22 budget, with a package worth more than $17bn to be unveiled.The government is describing the package as a \u201conce-in-a-generation investment\u201d into the sector that will respond to the issues raised in the royal commission into aged care, which delivered its damning final report last year. The royal commission\u2019s recommendations were estimated to cost an extra $10bn a year. The package will direct funding towards improving safety and quality standards, ensuring the sustainability of private providers and increasing the availability of home care packages. A key part of the package will also be a major workforce initiative aimed at addressing the chronic skills and staffing shortages experienced in the sector. Childcare The government has announced a $1.7bn package for increased childcare subsidies, which focus on low and middle-income families with more than one child. The main cost of the changes \u2013 which don\u2019t come into effect until July 2022 \u2013 is to increase the subsidy to 95% of the daily fee, up from 85% for second and subsequent children. A cap of $10,560 will also be scrapped in a move that will benefit higher-income earners. Infrastructure More than $4bn will be spent on infrastructure, including $2bn in funding for an intermodal terminal in Melbourne and more than $2bn to upgrade the Great Western Highway between Katoomba and Lithgow in Sydney\u2019s Blue Mountains. The infrastructure cash splash will see money flowing to road and rail projects in the key battleground states of Queensland, WA and Tasmania, where the government needs to hold on to a swag of marginal electorates to stay in power. Separately, the government has also announced the Building Better Regions Fund will be given another $250m for its sixth round, despite the program being criticised for pork barrelling. Women Tuesday\u2019s budget will also aim to restore the government\u2019s standing among female voters, which has been buffeted by a series of misconduct scandals first triggered by Coalition staffer Brittany Higgins alleging she was raped in Parliament House.   Related: Josh Frydenberg says budget contains more than $10bn for aged care as women\u2019s health package announced    The government has already announced a $354m women\u2019s health package, which includes $100m for cervical and breast cancer screening programs, and more support for mental health and wellbeing of new and expectant parents. The budget will include a statement on women\u2019s safety and health, with funding for domestic violence prevention to more than double to at least $680m. While nothing has been announced as yet, a major skills package focusing on female-dominated industries such as childcare and aged care is also anticipated. Housing A new family home guarantee is also targeting women and single parents with a program to support up to 10,000 single parents buy a home with a deposit of only 2%. Of the 125,000 eligible single parents, about 85% are women. The first-home guarantee, which allows first-home buyers to build a new home, or purchase a newly built home with a deposit of as little as 5%, will also be expanded, with another 10,000 places made available. And the government will also increase the amount of money that someone can withdraw from their superannuation under the first home super saver scheme, increasing the amount from $30,000 to $50,000. Climate and energy The government has already allocated $540m for new clean hydrogen and carbon capture and storage projects, and another $560m for international technology partnerships. It will also allocate $600m for a new national recovery and resilience agency to fund resilience projects such as proofing houses against bushfires and cyclones, building levees for flood control, and improving the resilience of telecommunications and essential supplies. About $60m will be spent on \u201cgas-fired recovery\u201d measures, and there is speculation that it may also provide funding for a new power plant in the Hunter Valley despite experts questioning the need for it. Business A $1.2bn package for business and digital government services has also been announced under the government\u2019s digital economy strategy. This includes more than $100m on skills, $124m on artificial intelligence, $200m to overhaul myGov and $302m on the My Health Record system. A $255m tax break for small brewers and distillers that lifts the excise refund cap has also been announced. The government has also announced a $371m biosecurity package to help protect the agricultural sector. Tax cuts The government is expected to extend the low and middle-income tax offset \u2013 known as \u201cthe lamington\u201d for another year beyond its 30 June end date. The offset is worth between $255 and $1080 for about 10 million workers earning between $37,000 and $90,000. Controversial stage-three income tax cuts are also expected to be confirmed in Tuesday\u2019s budget, with the $17bn annual cost of the measure to be reflected on the balance sheet from 2024.", "We should be funding stress leave and high-quality PTSD care for all victims of abuse | Richard Dennis [2021-04-08T01:34:13Z]": " Practical support for the thousands of Australian women who are sexually or physically assaulted by men is not simply woefully inadequate, it is nonexistent. If you are a casually employed woman in Australia who is raped or assaulted you are entitled to five days unpaid leave. In short, just beginning to recover from an attack would cost a woman on minimum wage more than $700 a week.   Related: Mental illness must not become a political football | Jill Stark    Imagine having to go to work in the days after a physical or sexual assault because you couldn\u2019t afford not to. There is no rent holiday for victims of violence, nor is there a discount at the supermarket. Imagine having to front up at Centrelink, or for a job interview, in the days after an assault because you feared being \u201cbreached\u201d and losing your unemployment payments. But of course, if you are a government minister who is accused of failing to support an employee who alleges to have been raped on your watch, or a minister accused of committing rape, you could be placed on taxpayer-funded medical leave and paid $7,000 a week. Christian Porter has strenuously denied the allegations that have been made against him and is entitled to the presumption of innocence. But no one can deny that MPs suffering stress and anxiety are provided with far more taxpayer support than women who have been the victim of violence. And while no one doubts the genuine pressure that Porter is under, does anyone believe that those who are the victims of physical or sexual violence are in less need of help? There should be significant government spending on paid leave and mental health support services for the victims of assault that affect more than 100,000 women each year. Providing all victims of sexual or domestic violence with the kind of support offered to highly-paid ministers would cost billions of dollars a year. And \u2013 let\u2019s be clear \u2013 employers don\u2019t want to pay for such support and neither does the Morrison government. But let\u2019s also be clear that the money is there. Australia is one of the richest countries in the world and, as described below, we never struggle to find the money when tax cuts for high-income blokes are on the table. It\u2019s not just leave for women recovering from violence that we need to adequately fund and fairly distribute, it\u2019s mental health care as well.    It is not that the government \u2018can\u2019t afford\u2019 to spend billions helping women and children \u2013 it\u2019s that it has quite different priorities    When soldiers, emergency service workers or medical professionals experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of what they endure in the workplace, the government (rightly) picks up the very expensive tab for treating their condition and helping them heal. But when women and children develop PTSD because of what they endure at the hands of violent men there is far less such support. We know how to help people with PTSD, but we choose to provide far more help to those who develop it at work than those who develop it at the hands of a violent man. It would cost a lot of money to help hundreds of thousands of women and children heal the scars that men gave them and, to be blunt, it looks like the government has no interest in spending that much money on a \u201cwomen\u2019s problem\u201d. It is not that the government \u201ccan\u2019t afford\u201d to spend billions helping women and children \u2013 it\u2019s that it has quite different priorities. In 2018 it was reported that sexual assault victims were waiting up to 14 months for counselling as specialist support services were so desperately underfunded and under-resourced. Each year the government spends around $41bn on superannuation tax concessions to help some of us have a more comfortable retirement. Around $21bn of that goes to those in the top 20%, most of whom are blokes. But I bet you have never heard a Morrison government minister say that the government \u201ccan\u2019t afford\u201d to help rich blokes retire even richer. Then there\u2019s the looming tax cuts. By July 2024 people earning more than $200,000 a year (or $3,900 a week) will reap a more than $9,000 a year windfall in the form of Stage 3 tax cuts. And, you guessed it, 74% of people earning that much are blokes. Despite these tax cuts costing almost $19bn a year, again, we have not heard a peep from the Coalition about these enormous and permanent tax cuts being \u201cunaffordable\u201d or \u201cunsustainable\u201d. Such negative adjectives are only ever used to describe spending on those in need.

But, despite our wealth and despite recognising the benefits of stress leave for members of his cabinet, the PM does not seem to think that his government should be funding stress leave and high-quality PTSD care for all victims of abuse. We all know how hard people find it to tell Scott Morrison what is going on. But we also all know that conversations with his ministers have clearly made him understand the benefits of letting those who have experienced severe stress recover before they return to work.

But the federal court has rejected an urgent bid to overturn the ban. Justice Thomas Thawley dismissed the first two grounds, which argued that the health minister, Greg Hunt, failed to ensure the ban was \u201cno more restrictive or intrusive than is required\u201d; and that the Biosecurity Act was not clear enough to override Australians\u2019 common law right to enter their country. With that said, experts say the ban is simply politics and not based on science. \u201cSome of it comes down to whether you respect one medical expert over another, and that\u2019s when the government has the opportunity to take a political decision,\u201d says expert Robert Booy.

The country\u2019s crowded capital, Port Moresby, is the epicentre of the latest outbreak. The city recorded just five cases for all of January, and 124 for February. But 108 cases have been confirmed in the first four days of March as community transmission accelerates.   Related: Papua New Guinea to fit ankle monitors to arrivals in Covid quarantine    PNG has reported only 1,492 confirmed cases for the entire pandemic, but the actual caseload is believed to be many times higher. Fewer than 48,000 tests have been conducted across the country of nearly 9 million people since the beginning of the pandemic, and, in many remote parts of the country, there is no testing capacity at all. PNG has not yet begun a vaccination program. Health authorities are also concerned about a spike in cases in PNG\u2019s huge western province, which links the country to Indonesia, and has a sea border with Australia. Travel between PNG and Australian islands in the Torres Strait is usually unrestricted but has been suspended for the pandemic. But at least six cases of Covid-19 detected in hotel quarantine in Queensland are in workers who have flown in from the Ok Tedi mine in PNG\u2019s western province. Queensland\u2019s chief health officer, Jeannette Young, said the AstraZeneca vaccine rollout would be fast-tracked across Australian islands in the Torres Strait. \u201cI\u2019ll be going through and doing the whole community on Boigu, Saibai and Badu, they\u2019re the three islands that are closest to Papua New Guinea,\u201d Young said. The chief executive of Port Moresby general hospital, Paki Molumi, said PNG\u2019s already-fragile healthcare system would collapse if the current spike in Covid-19 cases surged further. \u201cWe are testing all our staffs that have symptoms. There are many others out there in the community who have symptoms but are not coming in to be tested and continue to spread the virus. That is a big worry for us,\u201d Molumi said. \u201cSoon our clinics and hospitals will be flooded with patients beyond our capacity.\u201d A netball stadium, converted as a Covid clinic at the beginning of the pandemic, has been re-opened to treat overflow cases. The governor of Port Moresby, Powes Parkop, said the capital\u2019s healthy authority did not have enough funding, manpower or resources to deal with the latest surge in infections, and warned the capital would have to go into lockdown if confirmed cases reached 1,000.    Across the country, some hospitals have already closed, or closed departments because of funding cuts and surging demand. Boram hospital in East Sepik has closed its emergency department. Mount Hagen hospital in the country\u2019s highlands has received about one-third of the funding required to keep its services running, so it has been forced to close adult and children\u2019s outpatient services from next week. \u201cAll services provided at the hospital are essential and whilst we do not want to close any of them, there just isn\u2019t enough money to keep everything open\u201d, chairman of the Western Highlands provincial health authority board, David Guinn said. In the highlands regions, Mendi hospital was set to close its operating theatres because it had run out of anaesthetic agents and lab reagents.

These memories are so clear to me decades later because they were so unusual. My mum never stops and barely sleeps, so seeing her so wiped out by migraine was frightening. At first, mine were similar to hers. A sudden onset of blinding, stabbing pain on one side of my head, an overwhelming nausea, eventual forceful vomiting, dehydration, intolerance of light, exhaustion and fatigue. But while the frequency of Mum\u2019s migraines have waned over the years \u2013 and her symptoms, although debilitating, have remained similar \u2013 mine have changed, and become worse.    Now they make me cry. The pain begins on one side of the head but can end up on the other. They last longer. The pain is much worse. The vomiting is more prolonged. I\u2019ve never been able to identify any one cause, although dehydration, stress, wine (even just one glass) and exhaustion have at times played a role, at other times no role. If my migraine does not subside within 24 hours, that\u2019s when I know I\u2019m in for a hospital admission. I usually end up calling an ambulance or taking an Uber to the emergency department around day three, because each time I try to convince myself that maybe in a few more hours I\u2019ll be better and I can avoid the IV drip and admissions process. By the time I end up in hospital I\u2019ve been vomiting for hours, I\u2019m dehydrated, I have been crying on and off from the pain, have contorted my body into all kinds of positions trying to relieve it, and I have poked and prodded all manner of things at my head trying to burst a tension I can\u2019t describe.    Once the pain of a migraine leaves, I am exhausted for days, slur my words, feel nauseous and become emotional  Melissa Davey     I find it difficult to put migraine pain into words. I have been told by medical professionals I have a high pain threshold. When I broke my leg and elbow, the paramedics said my leg probably wasn\u2019t broken because I\u2019d be in more pain. I ended up requiring surgery for multiple fractures. I managed entirely on my own in the days after an adult tonsillectomy and throat abscess removal, despite being told I\u2019d need help. I say all of this not to sound tough, but to demonstrate that if a migraine were just a bad headache \u2013 if it was a pain that could be slept off, breathed through or relieved with some Panadol \u2013 then the economic cost associated with migraine each year would not be US$19.3bn in the United States, A$35.7bn in Australia and \u00a38.8bn in the UK. While I am lucky that many of my migraines can be treated with triptans \u2013 a class of drugs that don\u2019t prevent or cure migraines but nip them in the bud if taken the moment symptoms appear \u2013 they don\u2019t always work. The times when triptans don\u2019t work have been enough to significantly impact my quality of life, leading to hospital and affecting my work, hobbies and general wellbeing. I\u2019ve tried a migraine-preventative drug traditionally prescribed for epilepsy, called Topiramate. It took time to wean on to, and, when it did nothing but give me side effects without preventing migraine, took time to wean off again. I\u2019ve had imaging scans of my head. I still don\u2019t know a clear cause. Once the pain of a migraine leaves, I am exhausted for days, slur my words, feel nauseous still but no longer vomit, and become emotional. But I am so relieved the pain is gone I don\u2019t care about these symptoms, which really, are debilitating on their own. Despite the Global Burden of Disease study finding migraine to be the sixth-highest cause worldwide of years lost due to disability, migraine is an under-recognised condition that is often treated with the wrong drugs. It was not until last year that a GP suggested I try triptans and put me on a migraine treatment plan, some 15 years after my first episode.   Related: 'I'm not a hypochondriac. I have a disease. All these things that are wrong with me are real, they are endometriosis'    \u201cMigraine is quality-of-life threatening, not life-threatening, so is doesn\u2019t pull the heart strings for resources and funding in the way the conditions like cancer do,\u201d Prof Anne MacGregor from the Centre for Neuroscience, Surgery and Trauma at the Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, says. \u201cSo research and funding is extremely limited.\u201d MacGregor originally planned a career in surgery but had a six-month gap before her training rotation started in 1988, so she took up a research post at the City of London Migraine Clinic during that time. She stayed at the clinic for more than two decades because she recognised more work in the area was sorely needed. \u201cI became passionate about the field, particularly migraine in women, because there is a significant lack of understanding and a huge unmet need,\u201d she says. Not only has migraine research been underfunded, but the most recent data suggests the risk of migraine is 3.25 times higher for women than for men. But funding for women\u2019s health issues generally is woefully inadequate. This is despite the World Health Organization finding as far back as 2011 in their global survey of neurological disorders a \u201cworldwide neglect\u201d of migraine, and that migraine is \u201ca major public health problem\u201d. Attack frequency differs from person to person, but can occur anywhere from once a year to more than once a week. MacGregor was involved in research that led to one of the key breakthroughs in migraine treatment in the late 1980s with the development of triptans, the first specific drugs for symptomatic treatment of migraine. More recently, she has researched drugs that act on a pain chemical known to increase in levels during migraine. \u201cSeveral drugs for both treatment and prevention are now available, but they are very expensive,\u201d she says.    Another issue with finding treatments for migraine is that the types of migraines and their triggers vary so drastically. There\u2019s the \u201cclassic\u201d migraine with aura (sensory disturbances), migraine without aura, menstrual migraine, hemiplegic migraine (a type that causes weakness on one side of the body), to name a few. They can all be disabling. Prof Lyn Griffiths, the executive director of the Institute of Health Biomedical Innovation at Queensland University of Technology in Australia, leads research into genetic causes of migraine and new treatments for migraine sufferers. A migraine sufferer herself, she became interested in research when her son experienced his first migraine at just five years old.    Some people seem to think migraine is just a headache. Like maybe you had a big Friday night out or something  Professor Lyn Griffiths     \u201cAs well as the pain and nausea I get the neurological symptoms that occur before the migraine, in particular, visual disturbances, flashing lights, waving lines, and I can lose my vision for up to about 20 minutes at a time,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew my son was suffering from migraine at age five because not only was he saying his head was hurting and he was throwing up, but he was saying the whole world was shivering, and that it was difficult, the lights \u2018keep going\u2019. \u201cI thought: somebody really ought to be researching this, it\u2019s obviously genetic.\u201d Frustrated by how little information there was for her and her son, Griffiths decided to do the research herself. \u201cUnless you suffer from migraine yourself, you don\u2019t realise just how bad it can get and how much it can affect your life. Some people just seem to think it\u2019s just a headache. Like maybe you had a big Friday night out or something.    \u201cBut it\u2019s not like that, it\u2019s much more severe, it can occur through long stages of your life and during the most productive years of your life, and it\u2019s episodic, so many will get it again and again. And it can go on for days. It\u2019s just awful. You just cannot function.\u201d She says migraine is a common disorder, affecting at least 12% of the population and up to about 20%. \u201cBut because it doesn\u2019t generally affect mortality like cancers, it doesn\u2019t seem to have the profile that is needed for research.\u201d About 90% of people who suffer from migraine have another close relative who suffers from migraine, and at least half the time, it\u2019s one of their first-degree relatives. Griffiths has helped discover three genes that are now well-known as causing the most severe type of inherited migraine \u2013 familial hemiplegic migraine \u2013 which can lead to coma and paralysis.    Women often assume the severe headaches they experience with menstruation are something they just have to live with  Professor Anne MacGregor     \u201cIf you have a mutation in one of those three genes, you have this type of migraine,\u201d Griffiths says. \u201cThis is a type of migraine that clearly runs through families and in just about all cases there is a dominant pattern, meaning if you\u2019ve got it, your children have a 50% chance of having it.\u201d Griffiths says while there are now some good treatments and diagnostic tests for these rarer and severe types of migraine, for the really common types of migraine, the role of inheritance pattern and the genes involved are less clear-cut. She hopes in the future, the involvement of other genes in these migraines will be better understood, leading to more diagnostic tests and personalised treatment. Another barrier to treatment, however, is that a significant number of people experiencing migraine are either not properly diagnosed or are incorrectly diagnosed. MacGregor says sinusitis is the most common misdiagnosis. \u201cFor women, they often assume that the severe headaches they experience with menstruation or other hormonal changes are something that they just have to live with, without ever receiving a diagnosis of migraine,\u201d MacGregor says. \u201cThere still remains a stigma over headaches, with many workers not informing their employers that they have headaches for fear of being seen to be unreliable, so there is definitely room for better understanding there.\u201d   Related: Listen to your migraine to help you feel better \u2013 and to learn about yourself    Griffiths says that in Australia, GPs receive little training for recognising or treating migraine. Struggles to secure funding for better research and care is an issue around the world, she adds, which she says has led to a close collaborative relationships between migraine researchers internationally. According to the World Health Organization, in the United States and the United Kingdom, only half of those identified with migraine had seen a doctor for headache-related reasons in the previous 12 months, and only two-thirds had been correctly diagnosed. \u201cI think we really need to recognise that it is the most common neurological disease and the most disabling disorder in terms of the pain associated with it and the effect it has on your life. I don\u2019t think people realise that yet, I really don\u2019t,\u201d Griffith says. \u201cThat has to change, because people suffering need a better quality of life.\u201d Sufferers of chronic pain have long been told it\u2019s all in their head. We now know that\u2019s not true. The pain that can\u2019t be seen looks at why doctors are playing catch-up on chronic pain conditions like endometriosis, migraine and more \u2013 and what they have to do with long Covid.", "Queensland criticised for holding back rapid Covid-19 testing in remote Aboriginal communities [2020-05-18T07:42:32Z]": "Aboriginal health organisations say the Queensland government is holding back a $3.3m national rollout of rapid Covid-19 testing in remote Aboriginal communities, putting concerns for health worker safety ahead of conducting what they say is a \u201cgold standard\u201d test endorsed by the World Health Organization and already being used in other states and territories. In April, the federal government announced funding for a rapid-testing program in Aboriginal communities which cuts wait times to 45 minutes, calling it \u201ca game-changing improvement\u201d for people in remote areas who are currently waiting several days to receive their results. Eight-three sites were nominated nationally, around 20 of them in Queensland.

But the public health medical officer at Apunipima Cape York Health Council, Dr Mark Wenitong, said the decision \u201cdoesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to us\u201d. \u201cThis is one of the safest tests I\u2019ve ever seen. And it\u2019s point of care so it\u2019s not meant to be done in a laboratory. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re taking the same precautions that you would anyway around infection control, then that risk\u2019s completely minimised. \u201cWe have the right training, Kirby Institute supply that and the PPE as well. So if you\u2019ve got all the right training, there are no problems around infection issues for the operator.   Related: Coronavirus and culture: 'We're waiting it out in paradise'    Wenitong said when he was tested in Cairns, the results took three days to arrive and he\u2019s concerned by how quickly the virus can spread in that timeframe, especially now that restrictions are easing. \u201cWe can\u2019t control what people do for three or four days, especially when there are no isolation or quarantine facilities. In many communities there\u2019s very little infrastructure. And we will be looking at a lot larger percentage of community transmission.\u201d Wenitong said the test is a \u201cgold standard\u201d, endorsed by WHO for these conditions. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have a fast turnaround time so that\u2019s kind of part of what the WHO principles for removing restrictions is around,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have everything else shored up and the ability to assess fast and respond fast, then it\u2019s easier to release restrictions but if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re leaving communities vulnerable. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very important tool in being able to respond quickly.

Related: Covid vaccine tracker: when will we have a coronavirus vaccine?    Australia has committed a considerable amount overall to vaccine development. It has invested $333m in vaccines, therapeutics and Covid-19 medicines, including $256m in vaccines. But its contributions to one of the main international organisations working to fund vaccine research and development, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), is less generous. Cepi is dedicated to ensuring fears such as those Morrison expressed on inequitable distribution are not realised. Australia has contributed US$4.8m (A$6.7m) to Cepi during the Covid-19 crisis. Cepi has received a total of US$1.4bn from governments, private companies, and philanthropists.   Contributions graph   Australia\u2019s contribution sits well below New Zealand, a nation with a far smaller economy, which has given US$9.2m. Comparable nations such as Canada and the UK have given Cepi US$28.2m and US$278m, respectively. A Cepi spokeswoman said Australia had made separate contributions in 2018 and 2019, of US$1.5m and US$3.2m respectively, though they were not for Covid-19 vaccine development. The organisation is still desperately searching for additional funding. \u201cCepi urgently needs $700m to continue its R&amp;D work to invest in additional Covid-19 vaccine candidates to increase the number of shots on goal at finding a safe and effective vaccine and to advance development of our existing Covid-19 vaccine candidates,\u201d the spokeswoman said. Australia has made other contributions to vaccine development that do not directly involve Cepi, including $5m to fund the University of Queensland\u2019s molecular clamp vaccine development, and an active grant round of $13.6m to support promising Covid-19 development projects. It is also engaged in direct procurement with leading international vaccine candidates, and says this process is \u201chighly advanced with multiple candidates\u201d.

More than $30m will go towards protecting and restoring coastal ecosystems such as tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrass, which can store vast amounts of carbon but are declining globally due to ocean heating and coastal development. Almost $40m extra will be spent on managing the country\u2019s network of marine parks and $11.6m will be spent to help establish nine Indigenous protected areas in sea country.   Related: Changes to giant ocean eddies could have \u2018devastating effects\u2019 globally    A further $18m would protect \u201ciconic marine species\u201d and make fisheries more sustainable, the government said. The announcement came as the prime minister addressed a virtual summit of global leaders, convened by US president Joe Biden. Morrison has been under intense political and international diplomatic pressure for months over his refusal to set a net-zero emissions target for 2050 or to improve the country\u2019s existing 2030 targets. The US, Japan, Canada and Britain all this week announced improved medium-term emissions targets that are much more ambitious than Australia\u2019s, which remains stuck at a 26%-28% cut compared with 2005 levels. On Friday, Morrison told reporters damage to Australian marine ecosystems that stored carbon was releasing 3Mt of CO2 back into the atmosphere each year. \u201cThese mangroves and environments are often referred to as the lungs of the ocean. Some might even call them the liver of the ocean in the cleansing impact they have.\u201d Morrison said protecting those environments that lock away carbon \u2013 known collectively as blue carbon \u2013 was a \u201cbig part of the answer\u201d to Australia becoming a net zero emissions economy. More than $1m would be spent on work to better account for environmental and economic benefits of blue carbon ecosystems. The ocean was \u201cinextricably linked\u201d to the climate and was part of Australia\u2019s national identity, Morrison said. A study for the United Nations earlier this year calculated the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, and Shark Bay and the Ningaloo coast in Western Australia, collectively stored the equivalent of more than 2bn tonnes of CO2. Michelle Grady, director of Pew Charitable Trusts in Australia and an ocean campaigner, said the announcement represented the biggest single increase in investment across Australia\u2019s oceans for at least a decade, maybe longer. She said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement will give Australia\u2019s oceans a fighting chance in what is now a global race to bring endangered marine life back from the brink, to reduce entanglement in fishing gear, to restore fish stocks and to address the pernicious invasion of marine pests \u2013 all whilst making the most of our rich coastal carbon sinks, by restoring the coastal environments that support them.\u201d   Related: Australia\u2019s vast carbon sink releasing millions of tonnes of CO2 back into atmosphere    While Australia was a world leader in marine conservation, with responsibility for the third biggest expanse of ocean in the world, \u201cfor many years, we\u2019ve seen a major gap in Australia\u2019s ocean stewardship \u2013 investment in sound management for our ocean territory,\u201d she said. Darren Kindleysides, the chief executive of the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said oceans were in \u201cdeep trouble\u201d from pollution, overfishing, development, invasive species and the affects of global heating. \u201cProtecting our oceans must be a top priority for all Australian governments. This funding commitment is a vital and promising package of measures to address some key threats, such as the loss and degradation of coastal habitat and capture of wildlife in commercial fishing nets.\u201d The funding would \u201chelp plug a significant funding gap in the protection of Australia\u2019s oceans\u201d, the society said.

But does the funding add up? [2020-06-23T01:56:36Z]": "The Australian government has promoted its planned overhaul of university funding as an incentive for students to move away from humanities courses and towards those deemed more likely to result in a job at the end of their studies, including teaching, nursing, maths, science and engineering. The initial focus of last Friday\u2019s announcement was on the large increase in fees for students who wish to enrol in humanities and law degrees, but closer examination of the package shows that it may not encourage universities to create more places for other courses, and that it will reduce federal funding available to each course on average. The package is incredibly complex and the sector is still trying to work out precisely how it affects universities and their students. Here are the key areas where the effects of the announcement may vary from the intentions the government said it was pursuing. 1. The government is cutting funding, on average The government says the changes will mean some students pay less and others pay more. But taken as a whole, the average government contribution towards commonwealth-supported places will decline.   Related: The road ahead is hard. Now is not the time to kill off studies in the humanities | Alexis Wright    At present, the government contributes about 58% and the student pays the remaining 42% of the $20,597 average cost of a degree. A government discussion paper indicates the commonwealth share will decline to 52% on average. And the average total funding \u2013 including government and student contributions \u2013 will go down to $19,389. This has echoes of the Coalition government\u2019s ill-fated package to deregulate university fees in 2014, when the then education minister, Christopher Pyne, argued that moving from a 60:40 split in government-student contributions to 50:50 was fair. 2. The impact on overall funding doesn\u2019t always match up with the government\u2019s rhetoric on priority study areas The impact of the latest proposal varies depending on the subject area, but it\u2019s worth focusing on the total of government and student contributions. Contrary to the government\u2019s rhetoric, the humanities are set to experience big raw-dollar value increases in total available funding per place, driven by the big increase in student fees \u2013 arguably providing an incentive for universities to enrol more of those students. (As is current practice, the student contribution can be deferred through Hecs-Help, allowing students to wait until they have entered the workforce to start paying back their uni debts.) However, education, nursing, allied health, clinical psychology, agriculture, mathematics, engineering, science, environmental studies and medical science will all receive less available funding per place. While the priority areas have cuts in student fees in a bid to \u201cincentivise\u201d students to take up those courses, the total available funding available to universities for those places is the important factor when it comes to higher education budgets and priorities. The total of the student and commonwealth contribution shows how much cash is available to fund a student place in a particular study area.   Australian university fee increases   The key is that final number marked \u201cTotal difference\u201d. If there is a minus before the number, it means the total student and government funding available for a place in that field is going down by that amount. If there\u2019s no minus, the total available is increasing by that amount. Even though the education minister, Dan Tehan, said last week the government wanted to increase the number of graduates in areas of expected employment growth and demand \u2013 such as teaching, nursing, agriculture, IT, and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) \u2013 the total funding doesn\u2019t always match up with this pledge. The government argues its new funding model is better linked to the cost of universities delivering those particular subject areas. In a discussion paper, it argues the latest analysis shows some fields \u2013 including social studies, science, behavioural science, creative arts, nursing and education \u2013 are currently over-funded on average, whereas law, commerce, accounting, management and agriculture are all under-funded on average. 3. How does this fit in with employment and salary outcomes \u2013 and will it make a difference? Tehan has argued the government wants to increase the pool of \u201cjob-ready\u201d graduates. However, the following graph shows humanities, culture and social sciences graduates have similar job outcomes to science and mathematics graduates.   Graduate outcomes   And what about salaries? Some observers have argued that eventual salaries post-graduation may be a more important factor in students deciding what to study, given that the Hecs-Help scheme allows students to defer their contributions. Latest data show dentistry and medicine have best salary outcomes while creative arts and hospitality have some of the lowest salary outcomes among graduates \u2013 information that prospective students may already take into account when they nominate their course preferences.   Graduate salaries   4. With the government cutting the overall funding on average, how is it using that spare money? The government argues its funding overhaul will allow it to pursue some important measures to increase access to higher education.   Related: 'It's awful for our intellectual life': universities, Covid-19 and the loss of expertise    As the Guardian reported last week, the sweeteners include funding for an extra 39,000 university places by 2023. Other measures include:  $900m for an \u201cindustry linkage fund\u201d for investment in science, technology, engineering and maths education; $500m to support Indigenous, regional and low socioeconomic students attending university; new $5,000 grants to students from outer regional and remote areas to help pay relocation costs; a $50m research fund for regional universities and industry partners.  There is an interesting shift in the focus of the Higher Education Participation and Partnerships Program (HEPPP). As the following graph shows, the program currently provides help for students from low socio-economic status backgrounds. This will be broadened to support regional and remote students and Indigenous students in addition to students from low SES backgrounds.   Participation program   Tehan has confirmed while the government\u2019s overall $18bn investment in the sector would grow in line with inflation, the latest package is budget neutral. This confirmation is important, because it means the new measures are funded by cuts elsewhere (including the reduction in overall government funding per student place). This could weigh on the minds of Senate crossbenchers as they consider how they will vote on forthcoming legislation.", "'Blown away\u2019: Australian coronavirus researchers examine everything from breastfeeding to explosives technology [2020-06-27T20:00:11Z]": "More than 200 Australian studies into Covid-19 are under way, extending far beyond the search for a vaccine. Almost every Covid-19 research project being led by Australians has been captured in a report published on Saturday, including studies of breastfeeding guidelines for parents with Covid-19, filter systems to remove the virus via air-conditioning systems, monitoring of sewage to detect the prevalence of Covid-19, and repurposing technology normally used to identify explosives to see if it can detect the presence of Covid-19. The report was compiled by Research Australia, the national peak body for health and medical research. It\u2019s chief executive, Nadia Levin, said the report was not a complete catalogue of Covid-19 related research in Australia, but provided a useful insight into the scale of the response from the health and innovation sectors.   Related: Why does Covid-19 kill more men than women? Researchers grapple with gender mystery    \u201cAll of this Australian research kept popping up and we were blown away by the scale and scope of it, so we asked all of our members to share what they are working on,\u201d Levin told Guardian Australia. \u201cThere is research occurring here people wouldn\u2019t necessarily think about. We seem to hear about the vaccine research every day, but a whole lot of other essential pandemic and virus work is occurring. This is the first instance this research has been explained in one place and what we hope is it will help Australians to read beyond the headlines and have a real appreciation for our researchers here and their contribution to society.\u201d The research outlined in the report includes work at Bond University in Queensland to figure out what should be done if no vaccine is ever found, or if it takes several years to find one. It aims to map out a Plan B and identify some of the research required to establish how we can most effectively live with Covid-19 in the long term. Researchers led by the University of Tasmania are working to identify those susceptible to Covid-19, and whether certain people are more capable of asymptomatic transmission. As part of the study they are examining whether smoking or vaping makes people more susceptible to the virus, and whether these activities can increase community transmission. However, the report says the response of Australia\u2019s health and medical researchers has come at a cost. The sudden \u201cdowning of tools\u201d that happens when researchers are called upon to pivot towards an urgent pandemic throws existing projects, and their funding streams off course, the report says. \u201cWhen social distancing forces us out of our laboratories or prevents studies from progressing, it means experiments go cold and precious time and data is lost,\u201d it says. \u201cLike other parts of the economy, health and medical research is suffering. Without income from international students, university funding for health and medical research comes under threat. So too does the pipeline of research and researchers relied upon by Australians to safeguard their health.\u201d   Related: 'How is this possible?' Researchers grapple with Covid-19's mysterious mechanism    Research Australia\u2019s next report will examine the impact of Covid-19 on health and medical researchers and the challenges they now face.

Equally important as finding a vaccine is understanding what to do if a vaccine doesn\u2019t work, how to prevent future pandemics, and what drugs may or may not work and why.\u201d Other important areas to understand include infection control techniques and the most effective use of face masks. \u201cThis is not the sexy, cutting-edge stuff that vaccine research may seem to be, but it is equally, if not in some ways more, important,\u201d Collignon says.", "Coalition must ensure Australia won't be at end of queue for coronavirus vaccine, Labor says [2020-08-16T05:34:48Z]": "Australia should not be putting all its vaccine eggs in one basket, the shadow health minister, Chris Bowen, has said, although he shares the cautious optimism of his government counterpart, Greg Hunt, that a Covid-19 vaccine will be found. Bowen said he welcomed announcements that the government was in negotiations for advanced supply of any developmental vaccine but said governments around the world had been entering into agreements since mid-May and, three months later, 20 agreements were in place, accounting for approximately 3bn doses.

The health minister said Australia had signed two non-disclosure agreements but was \u201cworking with the most advanced vaccines around Australia and around the world\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s good news for Australia, but it\u2019s also good news for the world, a world with over 21m cases, with over three-quarters of a million agonising lives lost,\u201d he told Sky News on Sunday morning. \u201cThis is a genuine ray of hope, and we\u2019re advanced, we\u2019re prepared, and we\u2019re in a position to produce.\u201d Hunt said the world was moving \u201ccloser to a vaccine, and it\u2019s unlikely that it will be just one, it\u2019s likely that it will be many\u201d. \u201cThere are lead Australian candidates as well as international candidates, so we\u2019re making very significant process across a comprehensive vaccine strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cResearch, direct negotiations, the international facility which is a multi-country investment in multiple potential vaccines, and then Australian contract productions through CSL which can produce the vast majority of vaccines under licence if that\u2019s allowed, and we\u2019re very confident that that will come through.\u201d But Bowen said the federal government needed to increase its funding to Australian researchers. \u201cThere absolutely should be more commonwealth funding, and $5m to the University of Queensland is not enough when you consider that the government of Queensland is putting [in] $10m,\u201d he said. \u201cThe state government is putting in double what the national government has done and there are other vaccines under development in Australia with zero government support and funding for Covid-19. Some of those may work.   Related: Bill Shorten lashes out at profit-driven aged care and Morrison government over Covid failings    \u201cBut they will not reach the level we need without the government funding and the government also needs to be putting more into the international efforts, the cooperative international efforts to develop a vaccine. \u201cOf course more needs to be done. Just this week, the government issued a call for information about manufacturers whether they could help and gave them a few days to respond. I mean, that is very late, very late, very rushed and more could have been done earlier and more still can be done now.\u201d Bowen did agree with Hunt that there were \u201csome signs for cautious optimism\u201d a solution to the Covid virus puzzle would still be found. \u201cThere are around 160 vaccines in various stages of clinical trials, we know they have a 96% failure rate so most of those will not come to fruition but a few will,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cA few will. That is while I am saying we should not put all our eggs in the one basket, we should be managing risks and investing in multiple vaccines and striking multiple agreements so Australia is at the best place to have access to it, but there are some signs for optimism.

Greg Sheppard, a former Queensland prosecutor, has been bailed on two charges of conspiracy and two of false pretence, but will \u201cvigorously defend\u201d the charges, the Guardian has been told. Almost $100m has allegedly been defrauded from a trust fund established to finance development projects in communities which have been devastated by massive environmental damage wreaked by the Ok Tedi copper and goldmine.   Related: Papua New Guinea ambulance service given no money in budget    Police allege 268m kina was misappropriated from the Western Province People\u2019s Dividends Community Mine Continuation Agreement (WPPD CMCA) trust fund and improperly paid into the accounts of the Ok Tedi Fly River Development Foundation (OTFRDF) and Sheppard\u2019s law firm. The trust fund was established with profits from the Ok Tedi mine to fund development projects, such as roads, schools and health clinics for villages in Western Province impacted by the mine. When BHP built Ok Tedi on difficult mountainous terrain near PNG\u2019s border with Indonesia in 1984, it did not construct a tailings dam to store waste from the giant mine, instead pumping sludge directly into the Ok Tedi and Fly rivers. The tens of millions of tonnes of tailings discharged each year over decades killed fish and trees, poisoned croplands and drinking water, and devastated the area\u2019s economy, sparking a large-scale, and ultimately successful, lawsuit by locals against the miner, and the establishment of the trust fund. But for years, residents of those villages, and politicians in Port Moresby, have complained that none of the compensation promised has ever reached the communities of Western Province, which remain some of the most impoverished in the country. The Ok Tedi Fly River Development Foundation (OTFRDF), a not-for-profit organisation representing the communities affected by Ok Tedi mine pollution, says the money was legitimately transferred following a 2018 decision from the national court which ordered the OTFRDF replace the PNG government as trustees of the fund. \u201cThe Ok Tedi Fly River Development Fund mission is to recover money that rightfully belongs to the pollution-affected people of the Fly River region and has been misappropriated over two decades,\u201d a spokesperson for OTFRDF said. \u201cThe national court appointed OTFRDF as trustee of some of these funds \u2026 [in] 2018. We have won every case that has gone before the PNG courts, and legally transferred the funds into the trust accounts of our lawyers, both in PNG and overseas. \u201cAttempts to arrest members of our board, including Edna Oai, follows these successful legal actions. It is an unlawful attempt by powerful forces in PNG to keep control of money that rightfully belongs to the pollution-affected people of the Fly River region.\u201d A spokesperson for Sheppard\u2019s law firm, Young and Williams, said it had, at all times, acted on the advice of OTFRDF \u201cand all transactions have been in accordance with the PNG court order\u201d. \u201cYoung and Williams is the only major law firm in PNG that does not work for the government, and as such we are one of the only law firms willing to take legal action against the government on behalf of clients. The charges levelled against our firm\u2019s partner are politically motivated and follow the PNG government\u2019s failure in the court system. The charges will be defended vigorously.\u201d But in a statement issued on Thursday, the PNG police commissioner, David Manning, said the transactions were not authorised. He said investigations were continuing and \u201cother suspects will also be brought in for inquiry into their alleged involvement in committing the fraud\u201d. \u201cThe investigation remains ongoing and includes a detailed forensic investigation into \u2026 the expenditure of the 268m kina, which police will allege were not authorised by the trust \u2026 this includes forwarding proceeds from the 268m kina to personal bank accounts.\u201d Earlier this month, 45-year-old Edna Oai, from South Fly district in Western Province, was charged with 15 counts of false pretence, conspiracy and misappropriation over the alleged fraud. Gregory James Sheppard, an Australian citizen, has practised law in PNG for more than three decades, and is a partner at Port Moresby law firm Young and Williams.

", "Sensor taps and no door handles: Covid-19 shows it's time to rethink public toilets [2020-05-03T17:30:04Z]": "Public health experts, designers and architects say the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed fundamental flaws in the design of public toilets that risk spreading a second wave of coronavirus, and possibly even new pandemics. \nThe pandemic has sparked calls for the introduction of building codes and design innovation for all future structures to comply with infection control measures, with greater input from disease specialists in construction projects that often see the design stage as a chance for cost cutting. \nSome of the suggested innovations include a greater uptake of sensor taps, fully self-cleaning cubicles, designing exits that don\u2019t require human contact, and having bathroom attendants. \nProponents of these ideas say they would improve hygiene by minimising the amount of exposure to potentially infected surfaces and also boost public confidence in the cleanliness of public conveniences, with some arguing the net effect would even be good for the post-pandemic economic recovery. \nThe World Health Organization has acknowledged the shortcomings of conventional public toilet design, distributing advice on safe hand washing that instructs users that in order to be protected from the virus, people should use a paper towel to turn off the tap after washing their hands. \nIn Australia, Brendan Murphy, the chief medical officer, on Friday foreshadowed that the public is \u201cgoing to be washing our hands in a new way for the rest of our lives even beyond this virus\u201d, even as the country begins easing tough social restrictions. \nPeter Collignon, a professor of infectious diseases and microbiology at the Australian National University, says the surfaces of taps and doors are a problem in public bathrooms, particularly in relation to viruses shown to be present in faecal matter. \n\u201cThe major way coronavirus is transmitted is via respiratory droplets, so you can catch it off surfaces that your hands touch ... There are other ways, it can even carry in faeces too. About 60% of patients show that,\u201d Collignon says. \n\u201cWe need to have public bathrooms open up as lockdowns ease, but the more non-touch we have the better. Taps that you activate by sensor need to be considered.\u201d \nCollignon, who has previously advised WHO expert committees, recommends using hand sanitiser after exiting a bathroom, because washing hands in a public toilet often includes touching several surfaces such as taps and doors that could transmit viruses. \n\u201cIt\u2019s time for a rethink on lots of things, and bathrooms are one of them,\u201d he says. \u201cCovid-19 and rates of other respiratory viruses are all dropping as a result of our hand hygiene and distancing measures so far. For the next year we\u2019re going to have to focus on Covid, but these measures could significantly reduce a lot of infections if we continue seriously with hand hygiene.\u201d \nCollignon says infection control is not a priority in building design, and more input is needed from health professionals. \n \n  Related: Australia's coronavirus lockdown \u2013 the first 50 days  \n \n\u201cInfection control and protections should be as vital to bathroom design as fire safety. You can\u2019t design anything these days without fire safety in mind, but when it comes to infection prevention, well, when you have to save some money, that often gets compromised. \n\u201cIt\u2019s about time we have a standard code for infection control when building. There\u2019s a cost in not doing this.\u201d \nIan Mackay, an associate professor of virology at the University of Queensland, says doors to public toilets should be re-examined to minimise the risk of touching a door surface, especially if a previous user did not wash their hands correctly. \n\u201cA non-contact exit would be ideal.\u201d \nMackay argues health and architectural collaboration should be \u201cfurther emphasised\u201d when designing public bathrooms. \u201cThere are other known viruses whose faecal-oral spread could occur via bathrooms,\u201d he says. \nSarah Bookman, who investigated the political and cultural implications of public toilets in her thesis for Auckland University, believes there are inherent design issues with the hygiene of these facilities that \u201ccan no longer be neglected\u201d. \n  \n \n  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\n  \n \nBookman says entirely self-cleaning toilets that sanitise the cubicle when a door is shut could be installed in greater quantities by governments. \n\u201cIt creates a dramatic gesture of cleaning, you can smell it, you can hear it, that process is going through it. I think those are going to be a real design feature in the future. Our current toilet practices are not sustainable. \n\u201cTo have washing your hands designed around using a paper towel to turn the tap off. There\u2019s going to have to be other solutions in the future \u2026 Using taps and flushes with lots of sensors will become more important after Covid. \nBookman, who has worked on public bathroom design at prominent New Zealand architecture firm Studio Pacific, says ensuring significant and visible hygiene improvements to bathrooms can even lead to a stronger post-pandemic economic recovery. \n  \n  \n   \n     \n    \n    Email:&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\n    \n    \n    App:&nbsp;download our free app&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories\n    \n    \n    Social:&nbsp;follow us on YouTube,&nbsp;TikTok,&nbsp;Instagram,&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;or&nbsp;Twitter\n    \n    \n    Podcast:&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;Apple Podcasts,&nbsp;Spotify&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\n    \n   \n  \n  \n \n\u201cThe presence of an attendant is one example. It can be important for people to see public toilets and public areas constantly serviced.\u201d Another clue that the bathroom has been cared for, she says, is to make soap dispensers transparent so users can see how much soap is inside. \nAs social restrictions are gradually lifted, Bookman says, people will be hesitant to treat public spaces as they previously did, and that in the case of public toilets, this will affect how much time they spend away from their home. \n\u201cIf you\u2019re not able to use public bathrooms, that limits your time outside ... In order to get people back into public life, you want people to go out again. It\u2019s good for the economics of the city.\u201d \nShe says those who will rely on public bathrooms as lockdowns are eased are mostly those on lower incomes, essential workers and homeless people. \u201cIn cities with poor public bathroom facilities, people tend to go to a restaurant, especially in countries like the US, to use their bathroom. That\u2019s just not a viable option, especially in a pandemic.\u201d \nBookman acknowledges new measures will be costly but says they will save money in the long term. \n\u201cNormally you can\u2019t put a cost on safety, but now after the economic hit of coronavirus, we probably can, because if you don\u2019t have good hygiene in public bathrooms, and minimise the spread of the disease, you can get a pandemic.\u201d \nBathroom designers and health experts should \u201cdissect every stage of using a public toilet and interrogate what solutions can be made around that to reduce touch\u201d, she says. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve almost got this little opportunity from the pandemic where people are going to listen and going to change. What we do now to fix public bathrooms, people will actually follow.\u201d", "Coronavirus hit to Australian economy to be outlined in budget progress report [2020-04-27T12:30:45Z]": "The Morrison government will issue an unprecedented progress report on the budget, outlining the coronavirus pounding to the national economy and the huge outlay to deal with the pandemic. The statement on 12 May \u2014 the first day of parliament\u2019s return \u2014 is being seen as a prelude to the federal and state governments easing restrictions on businesses. But the statement, to be delivered by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, in the House of Representatives and finance minister, Mathias Cormann, in the Senate, will also use the magnitude of the economic crunch to underline that recovery will not be swift. \u201cThe near-term outlook depends critically on this ongoing success [in suppressing Covid-19] and our ability to gradually ease restrictions so people can return to work,\u201d the ministers said in a statement on Monday night.   Related: Coronavirus  no excuse to push 'ideological' changes such as company tax cuts, Labor says    \u201cIt is reasonable to expect that the pace and scope of any easing in containment measures will become more clear in the period ahead while economic data on the current state of the economy will become more readily available.\u201d The review of government finances before the 6 October budget will resemble a mid-year economic fiscal outlook (MYEFO) usually released in December, halfway through the financial year. The government will be under pressure to nominate how it will pay for the $320bn in stimulus and safety-net schemes, representing 16.4% of annual economic output. Labor is expected to support the decision to release a detailed statement. Shadow finance minister, Katy Gallagher, warned on Friday the March monthly financial statement showed tax revenue was $4bn short of forecasts made less than four months ago. \u201cWith the budget not being held until October 2020 it is critically important that the government provide an economic update to the Australian people when the parliament returns in May,\u201d she said. The ministers said the May statement would outline the impact of the coronavirus on the economy and the government\u2019s actions to date, to be reinforced by an update on the economic and fiscal outlook in June, following the release of the March quarter national accounts. Those March quarter figures on economic growth could identify the start of a decline which might blend into a recession. There are increasingly stark complaints from industry sectors that the business-led recovery the government wants is struggling to get under way. Businesses are pressuring governments to reopen pubs, clubs and theatres before they are shut down for good. They also want borders reopened. Peak employer organisation the Australian Industry Group wants a first step to be the removal of restrictions on crossing state borders, imposed by governments in Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania.

[2021-02-26T19:00:05Z]": "As Australia joins the worldwide Covid-19 vaccine rollout, researchers keep emphasising that while we know the various vaccines in use are strong at preventing hospitalisation and severe disease, it\u2019s less clear how well they stop the virus spreading to other people.  While the term \u2018Covid-19\u2019 is often used interchangeably to describe both the virus and the disease, it is important to understand the distinction between the two. The virus is Sars-CoV-2, while the disease that can cause symptoms such as coughing and fever is Covid-19. We know vaccinated people are protected in 63-95% of cases from developing Covid-19 and its symptoms, depending on the vaccine. All of the vaccines being rolled out are similarly highly effective at stopping severe disease. The big unanswered question is whether vaccinated people can still pass Sars-CoV-2 on, even if they haven\u2019t developed Covid-19. Researchers keep saying we need more data and monitoring of those who have been vaccinated to understand this. But with more than 200m doses administered worldwide, why are we still unsure?   Related: How is the vaccine rollout going in Australia? \u2013 with Lenore Taylor    The chair of epidemiology at Deakin University in Melbourne, Professor Catherine Bennett, says the studies needed to determine whether the vaccine stops virus spread are among the most difficult to do. \u201cCountries that have a highly vaccinated population are those where there was an emergency vaccine rollout due to the severity of the situation, they were just swamped with cases,\u201d Bennett says. \u201cBut that means they are usually also the countries where measures such as lockdowns have been stepped up. So it is hard to know what\u2019s contributing to the stop of spread; the vaccines, or other measures such as lockdowns. \u201cThe other aspect is that all the vaccine rollouts have focused on those most vulnerable and at risk, but most of those people are in places with lots of hygiene and protective measures already in place, such as hospitals and nursing homes. So again it\u2019s hard to know how much the vaccine is contributing, because it\u2019s being given in settings that are not being as challenged by the virus as the general population.\u201d    The good news is that even if the vaccine doesn\u2019t prevent transmission of Sars-CoV-2 in most cases, there is already evidence that a non-vaccinated person who catches the virus from a vaccinated person will develop a less severe disease.  It is believed the higher the level of exposure to droplets and aerosols from an infected person, the more aggressive the illness. If vaccinated people don\u2019t develop symptoms, then the chance of it spreading via coughing and spluttering, where droplets containing high amounts of the virus are expelled into the air, will be greatly reduced. \u201cIt takes time to actually follow up people and regularly test and check them for their viral loads,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThis work is being done, and data so far is showing that on average vaccinated people have lower viral loads compared to pre-vaccination, or unvaccinated people.\u201d That\u2019s why ongoing monitoring of those who are vaccinated will be critical, the director of the Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases, Professor Tania Sorrell, and University of Queensland immunologist Professor Ian Frazer wrote in a review for the Australian Academy of Health and Medical Sciences published in December. Control of the pandemic will depend on \u201csustained and enhanced support for research and innovation to continue to deliver the knowledge and tools required to tackle the pandemic \u2013 even when case numbers are low,\u201d they wrote.   Related: Australia's Covid vaccine rollout: early errors, cancellations and missed deadlines    Professor Gregory Dore is an infectious diseases physician at St Vincent\u2019s Hospital in Sydney studying the long-term impacts of Covid-19 on patients admitted to hospital. He said the \u201cgold standard\u201d in vaccinology was to stop infection as well as disease, something known as \u201csterilising immunity\u201d. The rubella and smallpox vaccines are examples of vaccines that provide this extreme level of immunity. \u201cBut it\u2019s not always achieved for all vaccines,\u201d Dore said. A lack of sterilising immunity is not always a problem, however. Polio has been virtually eradicated worldwide despite its vaccine not providing sterilising immunity. Influenza vaccines don\u2019t provide sterilising immunity, and depending on the vaccine type have an efficacy of between 40-60% in terms of preventing disease. But they have proven invaluable at preventing hospitalisation and the burden of other diseases in vulnerable populations. It has also been shown with flu that other aspects of the immune system, unrelated to the immune response triggered by the vaccine, can kick in to fill the gaps. This may prove to be the case with Covid, but more time is needed to see if that effect kicks in. \u201cThere\u2019s some confusion in terms of all these different sort of efficacy end points,\u201d Dore said. \u201cThe main efficacy end point studied in clinical trials, and what we know most about, is the prevention of symptoms, and prevention of severe disease and hospitalisation. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for example show a prevention of symptomatic infection efficacy of 95%. A lot of people assume that percentage also applies for the ability of those vaccines to prevent infections to others, but it does not.\u201d In fact, Dore says it\u2019s extremely unlikely that any vaccine will achieve such a high level of infection prevention.  \u201cI think it would be great if we could achieve 70 to 80% efficacy at this.\u201d   Related: Despite some errors, Australia shouldn't politicise the process of the vaccine rollout | Ranjana Srivastava    And he said all indications are that\u2019s the case for at least the Pfizer vaccine, and there are some signs AstraZeneca will considerably reduce infections as well.  Dore says overall the primary aim of any vaccination program has to be protecting people from severe disease. All of the Covid-19 vaccines being rolled out achieve this. \u201cThe big question for Australia is what level of vaccination is required so we don\u2019t use strict restriction levers like lockdown and quarantine all the time,\u201d Dore says. \u201cThat\u2019s a tricky balancing act and still a moving feast. Do you reduce harsh measures once most adults are vaccinated, even if kids aren\u2019t yet? It\u2019s not straightforward. As a country we\u2019ll need to calibrate our response as we get more information. I think the next six months will tell us an enormous amount.\u201d", "Pests, pathogens and pandemics: Australia's biosecurity needs an overhaul, CSIRO warns [2020-11-03T16:30:02Z]": "Australia\u2019s biosecurity needs a major overhaul within a decade to protect people, environments and industries from a wave of invasive pests, pathogens and future pandemics, a CSIRO report has found. Interceptions of materials that were a biosecurity risk \u2013 such as insects, soils and plants \u2013 rose by 50% between 2012 and 2017, the report says, and new invasive weeds are establishing themselves every few weeks. The report calls for greater cooperation across all levels of society and makes 20 recommendations that would cut the \u201cgrowing strain\u201d of incursions and protect environmental assets worth $6.5tn.   Related: Early warning: human detectors, drones and the race to control Australia\u2019s extreme blazes    According to the federal government\u2019s inspector general of biosecurity, in a normal year more than 18,000 vessels, 1.8m sea cargo consignments, 41m air cargo consignments, 152m international mail items and 21m passengers arrive in Australia. The Covid-19 pandemic had brought biosecurity issues into the public consciousness and presented a \u201cunique opportunity to make transformational changes\u201d that would protect Australia in the future, the CSIRO says. Dr Rob Grenfell, CSIRO\u2019s director of health and biosecurity, told a briefing on Tuesday the current system had served Australia well but \u201ccontinuing business as usual with our biosecurity system won\u2019t work\u201d. \u201cThe current system won\u2019t cope and could expose Australia to significant social, environmental and financial risks over the next 10 years,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless we change our approach we are facing the risk of disease outbreaks, pest incursions, weakened exports, and damage to our global trading reputation and our reputation as a safe travel destination. \u201cAnimal, human and environmental health is all connected and a weakness in one is a vulnerability for all.\u201d A 2014 CSIRO report into Australia\u2019s biosecurity regime identified an epidemic caused by a virus jumping from animals to humans as one of 12 potential \u201cbiosecurity megashocks\u201d that were expected in the future. Kathleen Plowman, the chief executive of Animal Health Australia, which helped compile the report, said in the pandemic Australia was seeing first hand that \u201cwhat happens in animals can greatly affect human health\u201d. \u201cThe proverb that prevention is better than cure has never been truer,\u201d she said. The new report says weed control and loss of production is costing Australia about $5bn a year, with about 20 new invasive weeds establishing themselves in the country each year.  The cumulative cost and impact of successful invaders is also rising, the report says. Examples include the spread of fall armyworm, impacting agriculture in Queensland, and new outbreaks of Avian influenza in Victoria\u2019s poultry industry. The invasive pathogen myrtle rust is putting several plant species at risk of extinction, and yellow crazy ants are threatening world heritage areas and national parks in Queensland. Plant Health Australia and the Centre for Invasive Species Solutions also partnered in the report, which will be launched during a virtual workshop on Wednesday. Andreas Glanznig, the chief executive of the Centre for Invasive Species Solutions, told the Tuesday briefing: \u201cWe are under a level of pressure that we have never been in before and that\u2019s predicted to get more challenging with increased global trade and tourism. \u201cScaling up our current approach will lead to increased risk and increased cost. We need to change the game.\u201d The report outlines several emerging issues for Australia:  Urbanisation is making it easier for pests and diseases to move around, and for problems to spread. Climate change is making it easier for pests and diseases to reach new areas and makes native species more susceptible to invasive species. Biodiversity loss is making natural environments less resilient, with invasive pests identified in 15 of 21 key threatening processes.  The report makes 20 recommendations, including strengthening international relations, developing a single source of public information on biosecurity, and increasing engagement with Indigenous people at decision making levels.

The government leader in the Senate confirmed the deal in an estimates committee on Wednesday, as Labor probed whether $40m secured by Centre Alliance for South Australia had any connection to Senate cooperation between the minor party and government. Centre Alliance senator, Stirling Griff, told Guardian Australia although the minor party has a procedural deal with the government it has \u201cnothing whatsoever\u201d to do with grants in MP Rebekha Sharkie\u2019s seat of Mayo and Labor had sought a similar agreement before the last election.   Related: Can the Centre Alliance hold? Rebekha Sharkie faces 'betrayal' claims after universities vote    In the finance and public administration committee, Labor\u2019s Katy Gallagher asked Cormann whether the Coalition had a deal with Centre Alliance to vote with the government on procedural motions. \u201cWe certainly have an agreement that Centre Alliance would not be supporting Labor attempts to disrupt the government\u2019s program,\u201d he replied. Griff said the written agreement is 18 months to two years old, and sets out that in the ordinary course of events the government should be able to present its legislation to the Senate without disruption. The deal is subject to a list of exceptions including disallowance motions, matters pertaining to South Australia, allegations of misconduct and privileges issues, contempt of the Senate and failure to comply with orders to produce documents. Griff said before the 2019 election Labor had asked the minor party for the same type of assurances. After the October budget, Sharkie wrote to constituents that Centre Alliance had \u201cdirectly negotiated\u201d $40m of road, sporting and health projects including $15m for road upgrades near the Verdun interchange, $12m for overtaking lanes on Victor Harbor Road, and two $5m grants for sports centres in Mount Barker and Goolwa. Asked whether the government gave undertakings to fund projects in return for Senate votes, Cormann said \u201cno\u201d he had never written a deal offering such a quid pro quo. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s a matter of public record I\u2019ve made commitments on behalf of the government on matters raised with us,\u201d he said. Griff and a spokeswoman for Sharkie have also denied trading votes, such as their support for the Coalition\u2019s higher education package, for budget funding. Sharkie has faced a backlash over the higher education vote, even denying that she will join the Liberal party in the wake of the controversy. Griff said the procedural deal prevents \u201cmalicious disruption\u201d of government business to stop parties \u201cplaying games\u201d in the Senate, and the same would apply to both sides of politics in government. He said there was \u201cno connection\u201d between grants funding and the procedural deal or other Senate votes, including on higher education. \u201cThe government wants to look good in Mayo \u2013 it\u2019s an investment in their future,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to keep voters sweet in Mayo, so they\u2019re very receptive to any proposal.\u201d On Tuesday Labor and the Greens questioned a $103m top-up in the budget for the community development grant program that paid for the two $5m Mayo projects and a $23m grant to the Rocky Sports Club for its proposed 16,000 seat stadium in Rockhampton. The grant was announced by both National MP Michelle Landry and Pauline Hanson, prompting anger from former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce that the One Nation leader had claimed credit for the government project. On Tuesday infrastructure department officials revealed the $103m has also funded a $3.5m Holocaust museum in Queensland and four more projects in Mayo:  $2.6m for the Amy Gillett Bikeway between Mount Torrens and Birdwood $1.5m for the McLaren Vale to McLaren Flat pathway $1m for the Mount Barker and Victor Harbour TAFE campuses; and $300,000 for the Yankalilla community library    Related: Labor says community grants scheme that received $103m in budget is a Coalition 'slush fund'    Of the remaining funding, some $35m is for \u201cdecisions taken but not yet announced\u201d while $27m has not been allocated. In the hearing, Greens senator Janet Rice said it was \u201cvery suspicious\u201d that most of the grants had gone to South Australia while the government was negotiating with Centre Alliance over higher education changes. Rice told Guardian Australia the projects were \u201call in places that would help the Morrison government secure minor party votes\u201d. \u201cThe [community development grants] are a slush fund for the government to try to buy votes at election time. \u201cNow it looks like the Liberals are using it as a slush fund to buy votes from minor parties in the Senate too.\u201d Griff said the only deal done on higher education was for improvements to that bill, including more places for South Australian universities, protections for struggling students and four study hubs in South Australia.", "TGA investigating Clive Palmer-funded ads claiming hydroxychloroquine can cure coronavirus [2020-03-27T07:37:06Z]": "Prominent advertisements paid for by former federal politician Clive Palmer which promote a malaria drug as a potential \u201ccure\u201d for Covid-19 are \u201cethically immoral\u201d according to Prof Peter Collignon, a former World Health Organization advisor who worked on Australia\u2019s response to the Sars virus. The two-page ad in the Australian states the drug, hydroxychloroquine, when combined with another medication could \u201cwipe out the virus in test tubes\u201d and Australia\u2019s drugs regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration [TGA], is now investigating whether the ad breaches drugs advertising rules. The ad says Palmer \u2013 who has headed several failed businesses and has been hit with criminal charges following an investigation by the corporate regulator \u2013 had agreed to personally fund the acquisition or manufacture of 1m doses \u201cto ensure all Australians would have access to the drug as soon as possible\u201d.   Related: Australian doctors warned off after prescribing potentially deadly Covid-19 trial drug to themselves    The ad also quotes the leader of an Australian clinical trial for the drug who describes the combined treatment as a \u201ccure,\u201d even though the trial is yet to begin or receive ethics approval. The ad ran despite the TGA warning that the drug and its derivatives \u201cpose well-known serious risks to patients including cardiac toxicity potentially leading to sudden heart attacks, irreversible eye damage and severe depletion of blood sugar potentially leading to coma\u201d.     Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance, our daily email newsletter   Collignon, an infectious diseases physician in Canberra, said \u201cpromoting the drug like this on the current available evidence is a bad idea.\u201d He added it was problematic for Palmer to suggest the drug could be bought from other countries, which are already restricting the export of hydroxychloroquine due to shortages for people who need it to treat autoimmune diseases and prevent malaria. \u201cI suspect he will have great trouble doing this,\u201d Collignon said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have malaria here but overseas, particularly in developing countries, they rely on this drug for malaria. So if you gobble up all the supplies of chloroquine from overseas based on the dubious possibility of it working for Covid-19 then people will die of malaria. \u201cThe idea we can just buy it from other countries and keep it here in case it works is just ethically immoral. Yes we should study these drugs and do that properly with strong clinical trials, but promoting those trials in this way just creates hysteria and hype around a drug that the studies so far suggest is not even effective for Covid-19.\u201d Channel 7 has also promoted Palmer\u2019s involvement. Much of the hype has been generated by a small French study which, although reported by some media, has since been widely disputed, found to have omitted data, and to contain spurious results. A small but well-conducted study from China found no benefit to chloroquine being given to Covid-19 patients. Guardian Australia has contacted Palmer for comment. Prof Lyn Gilbert, the chair of the infection control group guiding Australia\u2019s response to Covid-19, questioned the ethics of accepting money from Palmer for research, given he has described himself as a \u201cvaccine questioner\u201d and has been sued for his business practices including failing to pay staff their entitlements, which he later settled.   Related: Decades-old drug in two Australian trials related to Covid-19 but experts urge caution    US president Donald Trump has also been promoting hydroxychloroquine as a Covid-19 treatment, and Palmer has been tweeting Trump\u2019s comments. \u201cPeople have died from this sort of nonsense,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cI have fairly extreme views about private support for research, and these are my views only and do not represent everyone\u2019s. But I believe it is difficult to maintain independence and the perception of independence by accepting money like this. I personally wouldn\u2019t accept his money.\u201d Guardian Australia understands the University of Queensland was caught off guard by the Palmer ads and was not consulted before they ran. The university has also since edited its original press release online about the clinical trial, in which the leader of the study Prof David Paterson described the treatment as a \u201cpotential cure for all\u201d. That statement has been removed. Paterson went on to describe it as a cure in media interviews. In a statement, the university did not answer questions about Paterson\u2019s use of the word cure and said \u201cThe drugs being tested are not approved for use for Covid-19, and people should not take them without advice from a doctor\u201d. The Royal Australia College of General Practitioners president Dr Harry Nespolon warned \u201chdroxychloroquine and chloroquine are not \u2018cures\u2019 for Covid-19 and they should not be used to protect patients from the virus until clinical trials are complete and the regulatory authorities have given the all clear\u201d. He said he supported the TGA\u2019s move to place tight new restrictions on who can write prescriptions for the drug following widespread shortages for people who need it to treat autoimmune conditions. Palmer\u2019s ads may breach the TGA\u2019s stringent drug advertising rules.

It\u2019s time for us to be more careful so this situation ends,\u201d said 30-year-old cashier Pamela Padilla. She said she was fed up of being isolated or having to socially distance when going out. \n   Mexico began vaccinating the public against Covid-19 last year, one of the region\u2019s earliest rollouts, but the effort has been hampered by delays in vaccine deliveries due to bottlenecks in supply, prompting the government to complain about hoarding by richer countries. \n   As of Wednesday, Mexico had administered 6.1m total vaccine doses, with only 767,979 people having received the full two doses, or just 0.6% of the population. \n    By comparison, in the United States, 130.5m total doses have been administered, and 14% of the population is fully vaccinated, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n   In order to better protect against a potential new wave of infections, Mexican president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said he would tap the armed forces and medical personnel to accelerate the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines. \n    \u201cWe must be prepared to face a possible third wave of the pandemic in better circumstances,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said at a regular news conference on Wednesday. \n   \n  In December last year, the president\u2019s soft touch on Covid-19 restrictions had been a topic of conversation, as bars, cinemas, and shopping centres remained open while the country dealt with high infection rates and contradictory messaging on how residents should act.  \n  But even after the government closed most non-essential activities in Mexico City, cases continued to rise, and fatalities soared due to the uncontrolled outbreak of the virus and the president downplaying the severity of the pandemic.  \n   \n    Related: Covid fatalities soar in Mexico as president condemned for inaction  \n   \n  In January, the introduction of new US travel restrictions on travellers showing proof of a negative test was a hit to Mexico\u2019s tourism after being a world outlier in refusing to implement travel restrictions.  \n   \n    Related: Mexico faces challenge to light-touch Covid approach as US restricts travel  \n   \n  Earlier this month, the US announced that they would loan 2.5m doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Mexico.  \n   \n    Related: US to send 4m AstraZeneca vaccine doses to Mexico and Canada  \n   \n  \n Updated at 8.14pm GMT \n \n \n  7.24pm GMT  \n  \n  Turkey has begun initial talks to acquire the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine, the health minister Fahrettin Koca said on Thursday.  \n  The minister added that the capital, Ankara, would receive a total of 100m doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of May.  \n  Reuters reports:  \n   \n   Turkey has until now been using Covid-19 shots developed by China\u2019s Sinovac Biotech Ltd, and it has carried out 14.13m inoculations, with 8.18 million people having received a first dose, since 14 January when the nationwide rollout began. \n   In a statement after a meeting with his coronavirus science council, Koca also said Turkey would be receiving 4.5m doses of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech by early April. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.30pm GMT \n \n \n  7.01pm GMT  \n  \n  Under the global Covax scheme, Iraq is set to receive 336,000 doses of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine on Thursday. \n  Health minister Hassan al-Tamimi came to Baghdad airport to welcome the shipment and watched as the cases were unloaded into refrigerated trucks, Reuters reports.  \n  Iraq received its first coronavirus vaccines of 50,000 Sinopharm doses from China on 2 March but has since struggled with demand. \n  On Thursday, the country recorded its highest ever daily toll with more than 6,500 new infections, bringing the total to 815,605. \n  Hi, I\u2019m Edna Mohamed.

Nearly 66 million doses of the vaccine had been administered in the US as of Wednesday morning, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n   The paediatric trial, which will include children as young as 6 months, follows a similar one launched by Moderna last week. \n   Only the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is being used in 16- and 17-year-olds in the US.

In a measure agreed in mid-March, Portuguese residents will be banned from travelling between municipalities between Friday and 5 Aprilto during the traditionally busy Easter period. \n   Portugal, a nation of just over 10 million, reported 423 new Covid-19 cases today while the death toll rose by nine to 16,814. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.58pm GMT \n \n \n  4.48pm GMT  \n  \n  People wishing arrive in Germany by plane are set to be required to show a negative Covid test before boarding from Sunday, the health ministry said. \n  AFP has the full story: \n   \n   The new decree must still be approved by chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s cabinet, which is expected to happen in the next 24 hours, the ministry told AFP. \n   \u201cAll travellers wishing to enter Germany by plane from March 28 ... must take a mandatory test before departure,\u201d the official said.

However, the study found 67% of pharmacies surveyed reported at least one customer refusing the AstraZeneca vaccine after recent controversies and reports of possible secondary effects; in 27% of pharmacies polled the number of patients refusing to be inoculated with AZ rose to more than 10. France has more than 21,000 pharmacies authorised to prepare and deliver prescribed medication of which 18,400 were due to begin giving AZ vaccinations earlier this month. \n  The programme was paused in France and many other countries after the emergence of reports of extremely rare thrombosis cases in people, mostly women under 55, who had been given the AZ vaccine. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) said the benefits of the AZ vaccine vastly outweighed the risks, and the AZ vaccination programme resumed four days later, but in a country with a large number of vaccine sceptics, the damage was done. \n  Pharmacies are allowed to inject the AZ vaccine only, which in France is restricted to those over 55 for the moment. Patients wishing to have the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines must visit their GP.  \n  The survey was carried out by Gilles Bonnefond, president of the Pharmacies\u2019 Union, who said he quizzed 2,400 of the organisation\u2019s members. He told FranceInfo that many of those on the waiting lists were \u201cyounger\u201d.

Most businesses and schools, as well as airports, have gradually resumed activity - with caps on capacity. \n  The country has seen an 85% drop in daily deaths, a 72% decrease in the critically ill and 86% fewer daily coronavirus cases since the pandemic\u2019s third peak in mid-January.  \n  Israel has come under international criticism for not doing more to enable Palestinian vaccination. It says Palestinians are responsible for such health measures in their self-rule areas. \n  A poll by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research found that 55% of Palestinians are willing to take the vaccine when it becomes available or have already received it, while 43% are unwilling to take it. \n  \n \n \n  9.02am GMT  \n  \n  Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust, the UK-based global public health body that has been influential in responding to the coronavirus pandemic, has said the biggest coronavirus risk to the UK now comes from overseas. \n  Speaking on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 on Thursday morning, Farrar said he thought that with Europe now on the verge of a third wave of pandemic the government needed to be cautious about the potential for the importation of new variants of the Sars-CoV-2 virus from overseas. \n  He called on politicians to use \u201cstatecraft and real diplomacy\u201d to overcome disputes over vaccine distribution to ensure the widest possible vaccine coverage globally, as the best way to ensure the UK was protected. \n  Farrar told Radio 4:  \n   \n    The biggest risk at the moment for the UK is outside the UK\u2019s borders, actually. The epidemic is halving every 20 or 30 days in the UK, it\u2019s coming down very quickly and the test trace and isolate system is now functional in the UK ... So the biggest risk actually is new variants coming from anywhere in the world coming into the UK in the coming months. \n   Over the last three months the UK has been effectively a net exporter of new variants, the B117 variant that was first described in the UK, but there are many other variants around the world \u2013 one originally described in South Africa, one originally described in Brazil. The biggest risk to the epidemic in the UK now would be importation from abroad and we will have to think very hard about summer holidays and travel in the summer. \n   \n  \n \n \n  8.58am GMT  \n  \n  The German chancellor Angela Merkel has defended her government\u2019s decision to procure coronavirus vaccines jointly with other EU member states, Reuters reports.  \n  Speaking to German lawmakers ahead of the EU summit, Merkel said:  \n   \n   Despite all the complaints, it was right to rely on the joint procurement and approval of vaccines by the European Union,\u201d she told German lawmakers ahead of an EU summit. \n   Now that we see even small differences in the distribution of vaccines cause big discussions, I would not like to imagine if some member states had vaccines and others did not.

India has reported a new variant of the coronavirus as it struggled with the highest single-day tally of new infections and deaths this year.The variant, described by officials as a \u201cdouble mutant\u201d, has been found in more than 200 samples in the hardest-hit western state of Maharashtra, which is home to India\u2019s financial capital of Mumbai. \n   AstraZeneca publishes full vaccine trial results. AstraZeneca has published its most up-to-date vaccine results, saying the vaccine is 76% effective at preventing symptomatic illness, citing a new analysis of results for its major US trial.Earlier this week, AstraZeneca released more data to support its vaccine efficacy. The interim results from the phase 3 clinical trial of more than 32,000 people found the vaccine was 79% effective against symptomatic disease, and 100% effective against severe disease and death. \n   Canada says AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine safe but adds blood clot warning.

city of Lyon. \n  The prevalence in France of cases of South African and Brazilian variants, which are potentially more transmissible, has caused particular concern. \n  Asked by senior MPs why France was not on Britain\u2019s travel \u201cred list\u201d, Johnson said that this was \u201csomething we will have to look at\u201d while warning it would cause disruption, particularly to cross-Channel trade. \n  Travellers from red list countries cannot enter the UK unless they are British or Irish nationals or have residence rights, in which case they have to pay to quarantine in hotels. \n  Johnson acknowledged that \u201cwe have to look at the situation at the Channel\u201d. \n  \u201cWe can\u2019t rule out tougher measures and we will put them in if necessary,\u201d he said. \n  Questioned on the need for tighter controls such as testing of lorry drivers arriving at Channel ports, Johnson told senior MPs that there was a need to balance the risks of \u201cvery serious disruption\u201d to the flow of goods such as food and medicine. \n  Hauliers are currently exempt from quarantining and testing measures, Johnson said, warning of delayed supplies if this changed. \n  When France introduced compulsory testing of lorry drivers arriving from the UK in December, it caused huge queues of lorries in southern England. \n  \u201cWe will take a decision, no matter how tough, to interrupt that trade, to interrupt those flows, if we think that it is necessary to protect public health and to stop new variants coming in,\u201d Johnson said, however. \n  \u201cIt may be that we have to do that very soon.\u201d \n  England\u2019s chief medical officer Chris Whitty and his deputy Jonathan Van-Tam have reportedly put pressure on Johnson to bring in stricter border

Covid-19 vaccine even as it updated its label to provide information on rare blood clots associated with a low platelet count following an immunisation shot.Reuters: Health Canada said it has not received any reports of these blood clots to date.Canada, which is using AstraZeneca doses manufactured at the Serum Institute of India, has received 500,000 Covidshield doses and expects to get 1.5 million more by May.The warning label informs people to seek immediate medical attention if they develop shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, or persistent abdominal pain following AstraZeneca shots.\u201cAlso, seek immediate medical attention if you experience after a few days severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision, or experience skin bruising or pinpoint round spots beyond the site of vaccination that appears after a few days,\u201d the label added.However, the health department said it had assessed the available data and has determined that the vaccine has not been associated with an increase in the overall risk of thrombosis.\u201cHealth Canada continues to be in regular contact with international regulators and the manufacturer of the AstraZeneca vaccine to review all evidence as it becomes available,\u201d the department said in its statement. \n  \n Updated at 6.27am GMT \n \n \n  2.29am GMT  \n  \n  More now on the extra data provided by AstraZeneca about its Covid vaccine, which shows its overall efficacy against symptomatic disease is 76%. Some people might remember that the interim results the drug company released earlier in the week had the efficacy at 79%.But this difference is not statistically significant. The newer, 76% figure has a confidence interval of between 68% to 82%. This means there is a 95% chance that the true efficacy of the vaccine is between 68% to 82%, making it similar to other vaccines including Pfizer\u2019s. As more data is added, the confidence interval usually tightens and provides more certainty. \n  A professor of epidemiology with La Trobe University in Australia, Hassan Vally, said the difference between 76% and 79% was not significant. \n  \u201cIn the scheme of things it\u2019s not changing anything when you take into consideration the confidence intervals,\u201d Vally said. He said AstraZeneca was correct in saying the additional data confirmed their earlier results. \n  \n \n \n  2.05am GMT  \n AstraZeneca publishes full vaccine trial results \n  \n  AstraZeneca has published its most up-to-date vaccine results, saying the vaccine is 76% effective at preventing symptomatic illness, citing a new analysis of results for its major US trial. \n  Earlier this week, AstraZeneca released more data to support its vaccine efficacy. The interim results from the phase 3 clinical trial of more than 32,000 people found the vaccine was 79% effective against symptomatic disease, and 100% effective against severe disease and death. \n  But soon after the results were published, questions were raised in the US by the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board, which said AstraZeneca may have provided \u201coutdated information\u201d from the trial, which gave \u201can incomplete view\u201d of the results. \n  In response, AstraZeneca has just released the additional data which confirm the efficacy results reported earlier this week. This has now been presented to the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board. An additional 49 cases have now been added to the previously announced interim analysis. \n  AstraZeneca said: \n   \n   The primary endpoint, vaccine efficacy at preventing symptomatic Covid-19, was 76%, occurring 15 days or more after receiving two doses given four weeks apart. In addition, results were comparable across age groups, with vaccine efficacy of 85% in adults 65 years and older. A key secondary endpoint, preventing severe or critical disease and hospitalisation, demonstrated 100% efficacy. \n   \n  The vaccine was well tolerated, and no safety concerns related to the vaccine were identified.Mene Pangalos, the executive vice-president of AstraZeneca\u2019s bio pharmaceuticals research and development, said: \u201cThe primary analysis is consistent with our previously released interim analysis, and confirms that our Covid-19 vaccine is highly effective in adults, including those aged 65 years and over.\u201dAstraZeneca will also submit the primary analysis for peer-reviewed publication in the coming weeks.Associate professor Paul Griffin, who is the director of infectious diseases at Mater Health Services in Queensland, said people should believe in the vaccine and that it is safe and effective. \n   \n   It is such a shame that a vaccine with so much evidence supporting its safety as well as efficacy continues to be shrouded in controversy. \n   We heard very positive news almost a week ago that the European Medical Authority\u2019s safety committee concluded that the vaccine was not associated with an increase in the overall risk of blood clots and therefore the benefits of receiving the vaccine continue to outweigh the risk of side effects. \n   \n  The request for more vaccine data was standard practice in drugs approval processes but had played out very publicly due to the intense focus on Covid and need for transparency, Griffin said, but he said it was important not to overreact when questions are raised.\u201cAs the only Covid-19 vaccine currently able to be manufactured in Australia, and [with] the exciting news that the first four batches have been approved for release, we need to continue to support its use in an evidence-based manner with faith in our regulator the TGA, and not falsely sound the alarm over coincident events with no established link or based on perceived issues with how results are communicated in the press,\u201d he said. \n  \n \n \n  1.55am GMT  \n New coronavirus variant, described as 'double mutant', reported in India \n  \n  India has reported a new variant of the coronavirus as it struggled with the highest single-day tally of new infections and deaths this year. \n  The variant, described by officials as a \u201cdouble mutant\u201d, has been found in more than 200 samples in the hardest-hit western state of Maharashtra, which is home to India\u2019s financial capital of Mumbai. \n  Health officials said the new variant had not been detected in large enough numbers to link it to the surge in cases in Maharashtra and other states including Kerala and Punjab. \n  Epidemiologists said the term \u201cdouble mutant\u201d refers to a new variant that has the characteristics of two already identified variants:  \n   \n    Related: New coronavirus variant, described as 'double mutant', reported in India  \n   \n  \n \n \n  12.47am GMT  \n AstraZeneca to publish full vaccine trial results \n  \n  AstraZeneca Plc is likely to release a new, modified statement about its Covid vaccine after a data and safety monitoring board expressed concern that the data in its recent public statement were outdated, U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Wednesday.Reuters: AstraZeneca said results it published on Monday in which the vaccine had demonstrated 79% efficacy were based on an interim analysis of data through 17 February, and it would now *immediately engage* with the independent panel monitoring the trial to share its full analysis.AstraZeneca will publish up-to-date results from its major US Covid vaccine trial within 48 hours. It said on Tuesday it had reviewed the preliminary assessment of its full analysis and found it to be consistent with the interim report.Fauci said he was concerned about miscommunication around Covid vaccine efficacy but was confident a revised statement from AstraZeneca would dispel any confusion about that shot\u2019s effectiveness.Fauci and Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, both expressed concern about the trajectory of the pandemic during a briefing with reporters, despite a vaccination program that has led to 84 million people in the United States getting one dose of a Covid vaccine.\u201cWe do have a lot of challenges in front of us with regard to the high level of daily infections yesterday being 54,974,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cWhen you are at that level, I don\u2019t think you can declare victory.\u201dWhite House Covid adviser Andy Slavitt said the administration was concerned about the new variant in Brazil and it was having daily discussions with officials in that country. \n  \n \n \n  12.14am GMT  \n US cases top 30 million as states race to vaccinate \n  \n  The United States crossed 30 million coronavirus cases on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally, as states accelerate the vaccination process by lowering age limits, Reuters reports.

Health authorities are racing to vaccinate in the face of the first uptick in new cases on a weekly basis since January. Against the advice of health experts, several states have lifted mask mandates and more infectious variants have also spread across the nation. \n  Here are the key developments from the last few hours:  \n   \n   India has temporarily suspended exports of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India (SII) to meet domestic demand as cases rise, two sources have told Reuters. \n   AstraZeneca has dismissed as \u201cinaccurate\u201d a report in the Italian press that 29m doses of its Covid-19 vaccine found in factory near Rome were destined for the UK. The manufacturer said no exports were currently planned other than to developing countries via the Covax facility. \n   The European commission will extend the bloc\u2019s powers to potentially halt vaccine exports to the UK and other areas with much higher inoculation rates. \n   Ukraine has reported a record daily number of Covid-related deaths for the second consecutive day, as well as its highest daily number of hospitalisations \n   Spain has restarted its AstraZeneca vaccination drive after a week-long suspension of the jab over fears about potential side-effects. \n   Finland is to resume use of the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine from Monday, but will only give it to people aged 65 and over \n   Belgium will impose fresh lockdown restrictions, shutting schools, hairdressers and non-essential stores. \n   Iceland has tightened Covid-19 measures following a spike in the number of new cases recorded in the country. \n   Coronavirus lockdowns are to be imposed in three more regions in France, including the city of Lyon, the country\u2019s government has said. \n   Turkey registered its highest daily number of new infections this year on Wednesday, adding 29,762 infections to its tally in the last 24 hours. \n   Luxembourg has announced a partial reopening of its hospitality industry, with caf\u00e9s and restaurants able to serve customers again in outdoor areas from 7 April. \n   \n  \n", "Brazil's daily death toll reaches 3,650; Spain records increase in infection rate - as it happened [2021-03-27T00:23:22Z]": "  12.22am GMT       We are closing this blog now. Thank you for reading along with us; you can find more of our coronavirus coverage here.     Updated at 12.23am GMT     12.08am GMT    Summary of key developments     The Czech government has extended its state of emergency until April 11, giving the government extra powers to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. Lebanon\u2019s private sector helps speed up the country\u2019s vaccination program by importing at least 1m doses of the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccines. UK prime minister Boris Johnson and US president Joe Biden have discussed the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine in a call. Serbia vaccinated migrants and citizens from neighbouring countries using the AstraZeneca vaccine in a campaign to expand an immunisation programme that has outpaced most of Europe. Brazil has unveiled its first two domestically developed Covid-19-vaccine candidates for human trials. While months away from use, it should allow the country to control the pandemic.  Turkey\u2019s top medical group has called on the government to reverse its reopening of the capital city and tighten Covid restrictions as new infections surge. Brazil\u2019s daily Covid death toll has surged to yet another record high after 3,650 fatalities were confirmed.  Mexico has recorded 5,303 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 651 more deaths, bringing the country\u2019s total to 2,219,845 infections and 200,862 deaths. On Friday 1,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were delivered to the Kimberley Aboriginal Medical services in Western Australia.         11.51pm GMT       Argentina will postpone the application of the second dose of Covid-19 vaccines for three months as a way of dealing with a vaccine scarcity in the country.\u201cThe decision aims to vaccinate the largest amount of people as possible to maximize the benefits of vaccination and to reduce the impact of hospitalizations and mortality,\u201d said health minister Carla Vizzoti announcing the measure on Friday.The decision applies to all the different vaccines available in Argentina: Sputnik, Covishield, ChadOx and Sinopharm. A second dose will not be applied \u201cfor an interval of at least 12 weeks after the first dose.\u201dThe scarcity has been brought on partly by Argentina\u2019s rejection last year of a Pfizer condition for legal immunity for their vaccine regarding possible lawsuits, which led to the cancellation of millions of Pfizer doses being negotiated by Argentina.The country Friday recorded its highest daily jump in new Covid cases in months, 12,900 cases, bringing total accumulated cases to 2.3 million people (5% of total population) and 55,235 deaths.Argentina Thursday also announced the cancellation of incoming flights from Brazil, Chile and Mexico in an effort to block the arrival of Covid variants in this country, where cases of the P1 Brazilian and B117 British variants have already been detected.       11.18pm GMT       Over-70s in the UK could begin getting booster vaccines to protect them against new Covid variants in September under plans for the future of the vaccine rollout programme, PA reports. The vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi has said that the first booster doses would go to the top four priority groups: including care home staff, NHS workers, and the clinically vulnerable. The minister told The Telegraph that the boosters would likely begin in September, adding that the government expects up to eight different jabs to be available, including one protecting against three different variants in a single dose.  A number of the booster vaccines will reportedly be manufactured in the UK.    Updated at 11.27pm GMT     11.00pm GMT       On Friday 1,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were delivered to the Kimberley Aboriginal Medical services in Western Australia. Health workers are due to begin delivering the jabs on Monday. The medical service reaches just over half the Aboriginal population in Kimberly, and aims to vaccinate 90% of people in the communities it looks after.  AAP reports:  Dr Giuseppin says most if not all Aboriginal community-controlled health organisations across the country are starting \u2018phase 1b\u2019, making vaccinations available to all Indigenous people over 55. But he says widespread flooding in several states has caused logistical delays. \u201cRoads get flooded, trucks can\u2019t get through, you could fly it in but sometimes even the runway is flooded,\u201d he said. Federal Indigenous Affairs minister Ken Wyatt told parliament this week that while 150 Aboriginal people have tested positive to COVID, none have died of the virus. \u201cAboriginal and Torres straight Islander people have got the worst health conditions, and you would expect the figures of COVID impacting to be much more significant than what they have been,\u201d he said. The government is coordinating with more than 30 Aboriginal-run health organisations, and the department of health is providing messages in 15 Aboriginal languages, he added. More than six million people will receive the jab in phase 1b of the rollout, including Indigenous over 55s, all people aged 70 and over, healthcare workers, and people with existing health problems.        10.20pm GMT       Top US government coronavirus experts warned on Friday that despite the optimism amid the accelerating vaccinations, \u201cthere is no case for relaxation\u201d in the pandemic with deep concerns about infections rising again.  Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said at a White House briefing that the most recent weekly average shows a 7% increase in infections in the US from the previous week, at about 57,000 cases a day. New hospitalizations have slightly increased, too.\u201cI remain deeply concerned about this trajectory. Please, take this moment very seriously,\u201d Walensky said. The US daily death toll continues to hover at about 1,000 people, with confirmed infections rising in around 20 states and deaths rising in 17 states.   Related: CDC \u2018deeply concerned\u2019 about rising Covid cases as vaccinations accelerate         9.58pm GMT       Mexico has recorded 5,303 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 651 more deaths, bringing the country\u2019s total to 2,219,845 infections and 200,862 deaths, according to the health ministry. It was only on Thursday that the country topped the 200,000 death toll mark, with a recorded 200,211 deaths. However, the number of people infected and death tolls are likely to be significantly higher than the official count, the government has said.     Updated at 10.05pm GMT     9.29pm GMT    Brazil's daily death toll reaches 3,650    Brazil\u2019s daily Covid death toll has surged to yet another record high after 3,650 fatalities were confirmed as the country\u2019s outbreak spiralled further out of control. The losses took the South American country\u2019s overall death toll to more than 307,000, second only to the US where nearly 550,000 people have died.  But whereas the US\u2019s epidemic is slowing amid a massive vaccination campaign, Brazil\u2019s crisis is accelerating into increasingly terrible new terrain and immunisation efforts are sputtering.Almost 60,000 Brazilian lives are expected to be lost in March alone, by far the worst month since Brazil\u2019s first Covid death in February 2020.Friday\u2019s news sparked renewed calls for a parliamentary inquiry into how Brazil\u2019s lockdown-sceptic president Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 who has undermined containment measures and called Covid a \u201clittle flu\u201d \u2013 has handled the public health crisis, as well as calls for his impeachment. \u201cBrazil has become a cemetery,\u201d tweeted Guilherme Boulos, a prominent left-wing politician.    3.650 mortos. O Brasil virou um cemit\u00e9rio. GENOCIDA!&mdash; Guilherme Boulos (@GuilhermeBoulos) March 26, 2021      Updated at 10.04pm GMT     9.25pm GMT       Turkey\u2019s top medical group has called on the government to reverse its reopening of the capital city and tighten Covid restrictions as new infections surge. Over the past month, daily infections and deaths spiked after Ankara announced a period of gradual return to everyday life. While the health minister Fahrettin Koca said on Thursday that the pandemic would be under control by late May or June, the Turkish Medics Association (TTB) said that the government would not be able to manage the pandemic, calling the current conditions in the country a \u201csocial assassination.\u201d Reuters reports:  \u201cA surge of cases in a short time show that Turkey, just like many other countries in Europe, is facing a tsunami. While this surging tendency continues, we need more serious measures strengthened by public solidarity,\u201d the TTB said. Without naming names, the doctors\u2019 group called for those responsible at the health ministry to resign, as well as for more transparency on daily coronavirus figures and variants detected, vaccine procurements, and the criteria used to classify risks by province. \u201cMobility in very busy streets in cities should be decreased. Mass contacts between people in enclosed areas should be limited,\u201d it said. Health ministry was not immediately available for comment. The government has previously said the coronavirus related measures will be updated every two weeks according to new case numbers on a province-by-province basis. President Tayyip Erdogan and his government came under fire this week for holding a party congress with thousands of people, many of whom were seen violating social distancing rules and not wearing or improperly wearing masks. Since inoculations began on Jan. 14, Turkey has administered 14.6 million shots and 8.2 million people having received a first dose. It expects to receive 100 million doses of vaccines from various suppliers by the end of May.        9.00pm GMT       According to the World Health Organisations\u2019 regional office for the African continent, rising cases of coronavirus in Africa threaten to overrun its fragile healthcare systems and test much-touted resilience to the disease.  The global health body stated that infections were on the rise in at least 12 countries in Africa including Cameroon, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Guinea. Across the continent, doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers are stretched to the limit as the total cumulative number of infections this week rose above 4.1m, with more than 110,000 fatalities, a sharp rise on the 2.7m infections recorded at the end of December. South Africa leads with more than 1.5m reported cases and more than 52,000 deaths. The WHO said only 7 million people had now been vaccinated in a continent of more than a billion people. My colleague Peter Muiruri has more on the third wave of coronavirus in Africa here:    Related: Covid third wave may overrun Africa's healthcare, warns WHO         8.47pm GMT       Brazil has unveiled its first two domestically developed Covid-19-vaccine candidates for human trials, that while months away from use, should allow the country to control the soaring pandemic. Brazil\u2019s health regulator Anvisa has said that they received a request to start phases 1 and 2 of testing the Brazillian developed vaccine known as Versamune.  Reuters reports:   The vaccine was developed by the University of Sao Paulo Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, in conjunction with Farmacore and PDS Biotechnology, Anvisa said. Brazil\u2019s Science, Technology and Innovation Minister Marcos Pontes said the Versamune vaccine was one of three federally supported shots. Earlier on Friday, Sao Paulo\u2019s Butantan biomedical institute said it will seek approval to begin human trials for its own vaccine. Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria said the goal was to begin inoculations with the vaccine in July, an aggressive timeline even compared to the recent race for COVID-19 shots. Butantan aims to produce 40 million doses of the new Butanvac vaccine this year, starting in May, officials said, which would help a sputtering national immunization program that has done little to stop Brazil\u2019s raging outbreak. Doria told a news conference that Butanvac production will not interfere with the state-funded institute\u2019s partnership to produce and distribute a COVID-19 shot developed by China\u2019s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. Butantan officials said the new vaccine had been designed to protect against the contagious P1 variant of the coronavirus, which emerged in the Amazon region last year and is fueling to a deadly second wave of cases overwhelming the hospitals. The vaccine was developed using a modified virus, which causes the Newcastle disease in birds, to elicit an immune response to a spike protein from the novel coronavirus. Butantan plans to test the vaccine on 1,800 volunteers over two phases, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters ahead of the official announcement.        8.18pm GMT       On Friday, Serbia vaccinated migrants and citizens from neighbouring countries using the AstraZeneca vaccine in a campaign to expand an immunisation programme that has outpaced most of Europe. Due to early deals with a range of pharmaceutical companies, particularly the Chinese-made Sinopharm vaccine, the nation has already administered more than two million doses amongst its seven million population.  AFP reports:   The invitations to migrants and foreigners comes as the country has started offering the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot, which has been cleared as safe but has lost favour in some countries due to unproven fears of a link to rare blood clotting disorders. Serbian officials did not respond to queries of whether the inclusion of foreigners was due to a lack of interest in the jab among the local population. But in a camp for refugees and migrants outside Belgrade, more than 500 inhabitants signed up to receive the shots, according to public broadcaster RTS. The UN\u2019s refugee agency praised the government\u2019s \u201cinclusion of displaced persons in the national vaccination programme\u201d. Foreigners from neighbouring Balkan states like Bosnia and North Macedonia were also travelling to the Serbian capital after receiving invitations to get the AstraZeneca vaccine. Most of Serbia\u2019s fellow non-EU neighbours, some of Europe\u2019s poorest countries, have struggled to secure jabs amid delays to the Covax scheme set up to help low-income nations. \u201cI am grateful to Serbia for this gesture on behalf of the citizens of Bosnia, it opened its doors,\u201d a man who received the shot in Belgrade told RTS. \u201cA colleague came to try yesterday and got vaccinated, and the news spread throughout Sarajevo,\u201d added another. Thousands of Macedonian citizens were also granted appointments in Belgrade over the weekend.          7.54pm GMT       UK prime minister Boris Johnson and US president Joe Biden have discussed the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine in a call on Friday, PA reports.  A Downing Street spokesman said: \u201cThe leaders discussed the fight against coronavirus and updated each other on their countries\u2019 vaccine rollouts. The Prime Minister stressed that global access to vaccines will be key to defeating the pandemic. \u201cThe Prime Minister and president agreed that combatting climate change will be a crucial component of building back better from the pandemic.\u201d They also both reiterated their \u201cshared commitment to protecting the Good Friday Agreement\u201d and the Prime Minister said he looked forward to welcoming Mr Biden to Cornwall for June\u2019s G7 summit, No 10 added.         7.33pm GMT       Lebanon\u2019s private sector helps speed up the country\u2019s vaccination program by importing at least 1m doses of the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccines to aid the reopening of businesses. The first shipment of 50,000 doses of Sputnik V arrived on Friday, making the country one of the few nations whose private sector is boosting its Covid-19 rollout. AP reports:  Jacques Sarraf, a Lebanese businessman and head of the Lebanese Russian Business Council, said he hopes the Russian vaccines help safely reopen businesses around the country. \u201cOur first target will be private companies, factories, banks, and this is important to reactivate institutions,\u201d he told The Associated Press in an interview. Sarraf, who played a major role in bringing the Sputnik V vaccines to Lebanon, said priority will be given for employees at companies and business institutions, including those of Lebanon\u2019s national carrier Middle East Airlines and the Banking Association.  With the private sector moving in, the numbers of people inoculated daily will multiply by more than three times compared with the current pace, he predicted. Sarraf said the Sputnik V will be sold at a price of $38 for the required two doses, in addition to hospital fees. The minimum monthly salary in Lebanon is currently 675,000 Lebanese pounds, the equivalent of about $60. Sarraf said Lebanon will be receiving between 100,000-200,000 doses every three weeks until the goal of 1 million doses is reached.  So far, Lebanon has recorded around 455,381 infections since February last year, with a total 6,012 death toll.  On Friday, authorities decided to implement a three-day nationwide shutdown during the Easter holiday as well as Eid al-Fitr that marks the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in mid-May.       7.06pm GMT       The Czech government has extended its state of emergency until April 11, giving the government extra powers to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. The cabinet hopes that measures will be enough to reduce infections and begin slowly reopening schools.  Reuters reports:   Hospitalisations stood at 7,965 as of Friday morning, down from the peak of 9,462 recorded on March 15.  The Health Ministry has said that wider easing of restrictions should come only when hospitalisations drop to around 3,000. Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Friday that with the number of new cases and other figures slowing down, some easing, like pupils\u2019 return to schools, might be possible when the current extension of the emrgency state expires. \u201cI firmly hope that this will be the last lockdown,\u201d Babis said in the debate before the vote.  \u201cAfter Easter, based on the situation, which I am convinced is going in the right direction, we will announce some dates for reopening of schools and other measures,\u201d he said.

Updated at 7.08pm GMT     7.00pm GMT    A summary of today's developments     Germany has issued Covid-19 travel warnings for a number of European countries, including neighbouring France, Austria, Denmark and the Czech Republic, Reuters reports.   Spain\u2019s coronavirus infection rate rose on Friday to 138.6 per 100,000 people from 134 on Thursday, the health ministry said. The ministry also reported 7,586 new cases, bringing Spain\u2019s overall tally to 3.26 million. The death toll rose by 590 to 75,010, Reuters reports.   France\u2019s foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Europe would not let itself be subjected to \u201ca kind of blackmail\u201d by Britain over supplies of coronavirus vaccines.   At least nine coronavirus patients died in a fire that engulfed a mall housing a hospital in Mumbai, India, authorities said.   The World Health Organization (WHO) has appealed for countries to donate doses of approved Covid-19 vaccines to help meet vaccination targets for the most vulnerable in poorer countries.   The European Medicines Agency has approved two factories for production of Covid-19 vaccines. EMA said in statement it had cleared the Halix production site in the Netherlands that makes the AstraZeneca vaccine and the facility in Marburg, Germany, of BioNTech/Pfizer.   Kenya\u2019s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, has announced a halt to all movement in the capital, Nairobi, and four other counties on Friday as the Covid-19 outbreak reached its worst ever stage in East Africa\u2019s richest economy, Reuters reports.   Poland has reported a new daily record of 35,143 coronavirus cases, a record number infections for the third consecutive day. This is a day after the country reported 34,151 cases, which was a daily record for new cases at the time.        6.55pm GMT       The Czech parliament has extended a state of emergency giving the government extra powers to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic until April 11, Reuters reports.       6.45pm GMT    Spain records increase in infection rate    Spain\u2019s coronavirus infection rate rose on Friday to 138.6 per 100,000 people from 134 on Thursday, the health ministry said. The ministry also reported 7,586 new cases, bringing Spain\u2019s overall tally to 3.26 million. The death toll rose by 590 to 75,010, Reuters reports. On Friday, public health authorities recommended that bars and restaurants should not open their inside spaces in regions with an incidence rate higher than 150 cases per 100,000 people, but businesses do not have to implement the advice.     Updated at 6.58pm GMT     6.34pm GMT       A warning from the World Health Organization about fraudulent vaccines.    &quot;WHO is concerned about the potential for criminal groups to exploit the huge global unmet demand for #COVID19 vaccines. A number of ministries of health, natl. regulatory authorities &amp; public procurement organizations have received suspicious offers to supply vaccines&quot;-@DrTedros&mdash; World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) March 26, 2021         6.29pm GMT       France will send a school class home once one Covid-19 infection is detected among its pupils, instead of three previously, in regions under tighter coronavirus restrictions, the education minister said.  Jean-Michel Blanquer said the new measure would come into force from next week in 19 departments with high coronavirus risks, Reuters reports. Since France began to impose new lockdowns in local regions last week to contain the spread of more contagious variants, the government has stuck with its stance to keep school closure as the last resort. Blanquer told reporters that keeping schools and colleges open in France remained a \u201cfundamental goal\u201d for the government. He said 148 schools out of 60,000 in the country were closed on Thursday.       6.22pm GMT       France\u2019s foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Europe would not let itself be subjected to \u201ca kind of blackmail\u201d by Britain over supplies of coronavirus vaccines.  Reuters reports:   European Union countries have said they are not receiving supplies of the shot promised by manufacturer AstraZeneca, among others, and have alleged Britain has been getting more than its fair share of the supplies.   Britain has said it does not believe in imposing vaccine blockades and that the EU must allow Covid-19 vaccine contracts to be fulfilled.  \u201cWe need to achieve a relationship of cooperation with the United Kingdom so AstraZeneca fulfils its commitments, signed with the European Union, and everyone gets what they need,\u201d Le Drian told France Info television in an interview. \u201cBut one cannot play like that, a kind of blackmail, where you wanted to vaccinate with all your might with the first dose and then you find yourself handicapped with the second doses. It*s not for Europe to bear the cost of this policy.\u201d Le Drian said Britain had outstripped Europe with its inoculation rates by focussing on first doses, while Europe was administering both first and second doses.  The EU this week tightened its oversight of coronavirus vaccine exports, giving it more scope to block shipments to countries with higher inoculation rates. British foreign minister Dominic Raab hit back, accusing the European Commission of brinkmanship.       6.13pm GMT       France reported 41,869 new coronavirus cases on Friday, compared to 45,641 on Thursday and 35,088 a week ago, Reuters reports. The number of people in intensive care units with Covid-19 rose by 57 to a 2021 high of 4,766, health ministry data showed.       6.00pm GMT       Brazil\u2019s Butantan biomedical institute will seek approval on Friday to begin human trials for a potential Covid-19 vaccine, officials said,. It would be the first jab developed in the country to reach clinical testing, Reuters reports.  Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria said the goal was to begin inoculations with the vaccine in July, an aggressive timeline even by the standards of the recent race for new Covid-19 shots. Butantan aims to produce 40 million doses of the new vaccine this year, called Butanvac, starting in May, officials said, aiming to help a sputtering national immunization program, which has done little to stop Brazil\u2019s raging coronavirus outbreak. Doria told a news conference that Butanvac production will not interfere with the the state-funded institute\u2019s partnership to produce and distibute a vaccine developed by China\u2019s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. Butantan officials said the new vaccine had been designed to protect against the contagious P1 variant of the coronavirus, which emerged in the Amazon region last year and is fueling to a deadly second wave of cases overwhelming the hospitals.    Updated at 6.03pm GMT     5.54pm GMT       The AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is still recommended for use while studies continue to examine any potential link to \u201cvery rare\u201d side effects including blood clots, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official said.  \u201cThe position stands that the benefits outweigh the risks,\u201d Mariangela Simao, WHO assistant director-general, told a news conference, Reuters reports.  \u201cIt\u2019s being investigated, a potential link to a very rare side-event ... which would happen (to) one in a million, is still being investigated by WHO and also by the European Medicines Agency and other regulatory agencies.\u201d    Updated at 6.00pm GMT     5.32pm GMT       NHS test and trace would need to collected and publish more data on on \u201cbasic metrics\u201d before experts can understand the impact changing the way testing is carried out would have on the transmission of Covid, government advisers have said. According to a paper from the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, Operational sub-group (SPI-M-O), dated to 10 March, there are a number of considerations that need to be taken into account when weighing up whether asymptomatic Covid mass testing should be carried out at home or at assisted testing sites, including ease of access, accuracy of the results, the risk to others of an infected person leaving home and delays in the system. But they say, basic metrics are also needed for them to be able to estimate the impact on wider transmission of changes to testing strategies. Among them, the group say they would need to know the proportion of people who have symptoms and ask for a test who had previously been told to isolate as they\u2019d been identified as a contact of a case the week before. \u201cIf NHS test and trace were able to collect and publish these and similar metrics, it would become clear how much impact the test-and-trace system is having on the spread of infection. Without such information, it is not possible to make robust calculations about the differential impact of small adjustments to the delivery of testing,\u201d they write.    Updated at 5.53pm GMT     5.18pm GMT       Italy reported 457 coronavirus-related deaths on Friday compared with 460 the day before, Reuters reports. The country\u2019s health ministry said the daily tally of new infections rose to 23,987 from 23,696 on Thursday. Italy has registered 107,256 deaths linked to Covid-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year. Patients in hospital with Covid-19 \u2013 not including those in intensive care \u2013 stood at on 28,472 on Friday, slightly increasing from 28,424 a day earlier.    Updated at 5.41pm GMT     5.07pm GMT       The World Health Organization (WHO) has appealed for countries to donate doses of approved Covid-19 vaccines to help meet vaccination targets for the most vulnerable in poorer countries.  Reuters reports:  The WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the Covax vaccine facility, run with the Gavi vaccine alliance, needed 10m doses immediately as a stop-gap measure.  \u201cCovax is ready to deliver but we can\u2019t deliver vaccines we don\u2019t have. Bilateral deals, export bans, and vaccine nationalism have caused distortions in the market with gross inequities in supply and demand,\u201d Tedros told a news conference.  \u201cTen million doses is not much and it\u2019s not nearly enough.\u201d    Updated at 5.44pm GMT     4.49pm GMT       The number of Covid-19 patients in ICU units in France has risen to 4,766, Reuters reports, compared with 4,709 on Thursday.    Updated at 5.02pm GMT     4.34pm GMT           Updated at 4.42pm GMT     4.21pm GMT       The UK recorded 6,187 new cases of Covid-19 on Friday and 70 deaths of people who had tested positive for the disease within 28 days, official data showed.  The number of new cases marks a slight drop from the 6,397 recorded on Thursday.  The daily deaths figure is up from the 63 recorded the day before although the overall trend has continued to fall.  Also 29.3 million people have now had a first dose of the vaccine, while 3 million have had a second dose.     Updated at 4.43pm GMT     4.09pm GMT       Italy\u2019s southern Campania region has signed an agreement to buy Russia\u2019s Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine, Reuters reported. The regional governor, Vincenzo De Luca, said the deal will become effective once the shot\u2019s use in Europe becomes authorised. \u201cWe have signed the contract after weeks of negotiations ... pending approval of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Italian regulator (AIFA),\u201d said De Luca.  Campania, which includes Naples, is one of Italy\u2019s most populated regions, with about 5.8 million residents. It has been among the worst affected areas since the pandemic took hold in February last year, with more than 320,000 confirmed cases.  \u201cOnce we have vaccinated our citizens, we will offer the shots we don\u2019t need to the rest of Italy,\u201d De Luca said.    Updated at 4.43pm GMT     3.56pm GMT       Here is the latest from Singapore:    As of 26 Mar 2021, 12pm, we have confirmed and verified that there is 1 new case of locally transmitted COVID-19 infection. There are 11 imported cases. https://t.co/8wYV9Ut1Pa&mdash; Ministry of Health (@sporeMOH) March 26, 2021         3.48pm GMT       John Magufuli, the late president of Tanzania, who died in mysterious circumstances, has been laid to rest in his ancestral village. Magufuli was buried in Chato after nearly a week of mourning by crowds in various cities as his casket was moved around the country.      Magufuli was hailed for his fight against corruption and massive infrastructure projects, but he achieved global notoriety in the final year of his life for his Covid denialism. Early in the pandemic, he halted the publication of coronavirus data in Tanzania and refused to take measures to halt the spread of the virus.  He famously claimed to have sent a laboratory five unlabelled samples for Covid testing \u2013 goat, motor oil, papaya, quail and jackfruit \u2013 and that four came back positive and one inconclusive.  Magufuli died aged 61 from what authorities say was a heart condition, after a mysterious absence of almost three weeks. Questions remain over the true cause of his death and Tanzanian opposition politicians claim he died from Covid-19.    Updated at 4.45pm GMT     3.39pm GMT    Germany issues travel warnings for neighbouring countries    Germany has issued Covid-19 travel warnings for a number of European countries, including neighbouring France, Austria, Denmark and the Czech Republic, Reuters reports.  People arriving in Germany from countries included in the list must provide a negative coronavirus test no more than 48 hours old at the border. On top of that, they must also quarantine for 10 days, a period which can be shortened if they get a second negative test after five days.       3.32pm GMT       Italy\u2019s government has said it is planning to take action against health workers who refuse coronavirus vaccinations, after reports of infections in hospitals.  The prime minister, Mario Draghi, told a press conference on Friday:   The government intends to intervene. It\u2019s absolutely not good that unvaccinated workers are in contact with sick people.  The justice minister, Marta Cartabia, was preparing regulation, likely a decree, but the details have not yet been determined, Draghi said, according to AFP. His announcement came after the Liguria region\u2019s president, Giovanni Toti, on Thursday called for a national law after at least 12 people were infected with coronavirus at two hospitals in the area due to two unvaccinated health workers. \u201cIn light of the need to protect citizens at a fragile time, such as hospitalisation, there may be the legal conditions, and also political, for a measure,\u201d Toti said.  Italy has a small but significant \u201canti-vax\u201d movement and some experts fear their numbers may swell following safety fears over the AstraZeneca coronavirus jab.

Gergely Guly\u00e1s said in a televised statement that the government considered business groups\u2019 proposals but decided to wait until first vaccinations reach at least 2.5 million of the country\u2019s 10 million people, a milestone he said authorities expected to reach a few days after Easter Monday. The prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, said the country was being kept from loosening curbs on movement and assembly by a record rise in coronavirus infections and deaths. Hungary reported a record high daily tally of 275 Covid-19 deaths and 11,265 new infections on Friday. Hospitalisations and people on ventilators are also at an all-time high. Once the a quarter of the population has received vaccine doses, shops can remain open until 9.30pm and a nighttime curfew will start at 10pm, instead of 8pm now, Guly\u00e1s said. The number of people allowed at one time will be limited in shops. This is Damien Gayle covering for Nadeem for the next hour while he has a break.     Updated at 3.21pm GMT     3.00pm GMT       Serbia began vaccinating its migrant population on Friday to curb the coronavirus from spreading in refugee camps, Reuters reports.  Currently about 6,000 migrants, mainly from the Middle East and central Asia, are in Serbia, mostly in 16 government-operated camps and cases of Covid-19 have been recorded. The AstraZeneca vaccine has been delivered to give 570 migrants their first dose thus far.  \u201cFor this ... population, vaccination is very important because they are living in a collective centre and keeping a physical distance is very hard,\u201d said Abebayehu Assefa Mengistu, a World Health Organization official in Serbia.    Updated at 3.22pm GMT     2.50pm GMT              2.37pm GMT       Mauritania began administering Covid-19 jabs on Friday, immunising medical staff first as part of a nationwide campaign in the West African state.  AFP reports:  Mohamed Bebbaha, the head of the reanimation department in a Covid-19 ward in the capital Nouakchott\u2019s central hospital, received the first dose.  Other doctors and medical staff who are in contact with coronavirus patients followed.  Mauritani has officially declared 17,712 Covid-19 infections since the beginning of the pandemic with 447 deaths.  The launch of the campaign follows the arrival on Wednesday of 50,000 doses of the Chinese-made coronavirus vaccine Sinopharm in the nation of 4.5 million people.  Mauritania is also set to receive about 800,000 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine through its participation in Covax, a global scheme to distribute coronavirus vaccines to poor countries.    Updated at 3.16pm GMT     2.24pm GMT    At least nine Covid-19 patients die after fire in Indian hospital site    At least nine coronavirus patients died in a fire that engulfed a mall housing a hospital in Mumbai, authorities said. Rescue workers were still working to douse the flames in an eastern suburb of the city, authorities said, adding that more than 70 patients had been evacuated to other coronavirus facilities. \u201cAt least nine of the 11 died of suffocation, and it looks like two had died of Covid just before the fire broke out. We are still awaiting confirmation on these two,\u201d a local government official, who declined to be identified because he is not authorised to speak to the media, told Reuters. The cause of the fire was not immediately known and was under investigation, the official said.    Updated at 3.16pm GMT     2.14pm GMT       Some of those volunteering in a trial of Russia\u2019s second Covid-19 vaccine have broken rank and conducted their own amateur \u201ccitizen experiments\u201d that they say raise concerns about the shot\u2019s efficacy.  Reuters reports:   A group of participants in the trial of the EpiVacCorona vaccine, developed by the Vector Institute in Siberia, have been running antibody and other tests to try to evaluate the shot, and sharing their experiences.   The break-away group is led by trial volunteer Andrey Krinitsky, who is not a scientist. The group\u2019s findings were made public in an open letter on their blog on Wednesday.  The letter says some volunteers have taken commercially-available antibody tests, while others have recorded cases of Covid-19 in their group and sent frozen blood plasma samples to independent laboratories to test the vaccine\u2019s ability to neutralise an infection.  The scientists behind the vaccine, which has been approved by the Russian regulator and added to the national inoculation programme, say it is safe and effective. The trial in which the breakaway group had been taking part began in November 2020 and involves a total of 3,000 people across Russia.  The government health watchdog did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the letter. In its earlier response, it cited early-stage trial results and said: \u201cSeroconversion, the body\u2019s production of specific antibodies ... to the presence of an antigen that enters the body during vaccination ... was recorded in 100% of volunteers 21 days after receiving the second shot. \u201cWe can conclude that the EpiVacCorona vaccine is an immunogenic and safe product for the prevention of Covid-19.\u201d    Updated at 2.41pm GMT     1.53pm GMT       France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, says he has no reason to be sorry about refusing to impose a third national lockdown earlier this year, even though surging coronavirus infections are straining his country\u2019s hospitals and more than 1,000 people with the virus are dying every week. Macron\u2019s government has stressed the importance of keeping children in school and businesses afloat as the pandemic stretches into a second year, Associated Press reports. Families of French Covid-19 victims say, however, that Macron has turned a blind eye to their suffering. \u201cWe were right not to implement a lockdown in France at the end of January because we didn\u2019t have the explosion of cases that every model predicted,\u201d Macron said. \u201cThere won\u2019t be a mea culpa from me. I don\u2019t have remorse and won\u2019t acknowledge failure.\u201d     Updated at 2.05pm GMT     1.40pm GMT       Here is more from Kenya\u2019s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, on travel restrictions in the capital Nairobi and four other counties. Residents of Nairobi and the four other counties were ordered to stay there and not enter other areas.  In-person schooling was suspended, apart from for students taking exams. In-person gatherings were suspended in the five counties, Reuters reports.  The new steps will take effect at midnight on Friday and last until further notice, Kenyatta said. He also said meetings of his cabinet would not be held in person until further notice.  In a televised address, Kenyatta said: \u201cWhereas the foregoing measures will have a negative impact on the economy, these measures are temporary ... the cost of not acting now will be far much greater.\u201d    Updated at 1.51pm GMT     1.26pm GMT    Two vaccine factories in Europe given green light    The European Medicines Agency has approved two factories for production of Covid-19 vaccines.  EMA said in statement it had cleared the Halix production site in the Netherlands that makes the AstraZeneca vaccine and the facility in Marburg, Germany, of BioNTech/Pfizer. AstraZeneca had said approval of the site could lead to the first EU deliveries by the end of this month.        1.23pm GMT       The mayor of Rio de Janeiro has implored residents to stay at home as the seaside city entered a partial Covid lockdown and faced what he called \u201cthe most difficult moment of our lives\u201d. On Friday, as Brazil\u2019s most famous city began a 10-day shutdown designed to slow the spread of Covid, Eduardo Paes painted a bleak picture of the situation. \u201cWe need to open our eyes and realize that this isn\u2019t a joke. People are dying. If everything carries on like this and nothing is done, God alone knows what might happen,\u201d Paes warned in a video message to Rio\u2019s almost seven million residents. \u201cNobody knows the limits of this disease or how many new variants might appear.\u201d More than 100,000 new Covid infections were reported in Brazil on Thursday \u2013 the highest number since the epidemic began in February 2020 \u2013 with hospitals around the country buckling under the strain. More than 6,000 patients were reportedly waiting for an intensive care bed this week as the total death toll rose to more than 300,000. \u201cThe whole world is alarmed with what is happening here in Brazil,\u201d Rio\u2019s mayor said as schools, restaurants and shops were ordered to close until 4 April. \u201cAm I supposed to ignore what all the specialists are saying and wait for our health system to be completely overwhelmed and run the risk of a super variant emerging that might even threaten those who have already been vaccinated?\u201d     Updated at 1.56pm GMT     1.14pm GMT       Sweden registered 6,328 new coronavirus cases on Friday, Reuters reports. The country registered 29 new deaths, taking the total to 13,402, health agency statistics showed. Sweden\u2019s death rate per capita is many times higher than that of its Nordic neighbours\u2019 but lower than in several European countries that opted for lockdowns.       1.01pm GMT    Kenya announces fresh lockdown in parts of the country    Kenya\u2019s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, has announced a halt to all movement in the capital, Nairobi, and four other counties on Friday as the Covid-19 outbreak reached its worst ever stage in East Africa\u2019s richest economy, Reuters reports. In a televised address Kenyatta said a wave of new lockdown measures, including a stricter curfew, the suspension of in-person schooling and the closing of bars in the capital, were essential to fight the spread.     Updated at 1.22pm GMT     12.55pm GMT       India, the world\u2019s biggest vaccine maker, said it would make domestic Covid-19 inoculations a priority as infections surge and had told international buyers of its decision.  Reports that India will delay deliveries of AstraZeneca\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine to a global programme to inoculate poorer countries triggered alarm on Thursday, with the head of Africa\u2019s disease control agency describing the continent as \u201chelpless\u201d.  India has exported 60.5m doses, more than the number of inoculations conducted at home, and says there is no outright ban on exports.  \u201cIn the coming weeks and months ... obviously there will be a demand spike and obviously people are preparing for it,\u201d Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told the Times Network\u2019s India Economic Enclave.  \u201cIn many cases, we have told our international partners that ... Covid-rates are going up in India, we are expanding our own vaccination ambit, so we are sure you will understand that at this time we have to purpose it much more focused at where we are.\u201d    Updated at 1.22pm GMT     12.43pm GMT       Chinese officials said experts voted on four possible ways that the coronavirus got to Wuhan.  They are: a bat carrying the virus infected a human, a bat infected an intermediate mammal that spread it to a human, shipments of cold or frozen food, and a laboratory that researches viruses in Wuhan.  The experts concluded one of the two animal routes or the cold chain was most likely how it was transmitted.  A lab leak was viewed as extremely unlikely, Feng Zijian, a Chinese team member and the deputy director of China\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said.  AP reports:  Chinese officials briefed diplomats Friday on the ongoing research into the origin of Covid-19, ahead of the expected release of a long-awaited report from the World Health Organization.  The briefing appeared to be an attempt by China to get out its view on the report, which has become enmeshed in a diplomatic spat. The US and others have raised questions about Chinese influence and the independence of the findings, and China has accused critics of politicising a scientific study.  \u201cOur purpose is to show our openness and transparency,\u201d said Yang Tao, a foreign ministry official. \u201cChina fought the epidemic in a transparent manner and has nothing to hide.\u201d  The report, which has been delayed repeatedly, is based on a visit earlier this year by a WHO team of international experts to Wuhan.  The experts worked with Chinese counterparts, and both sides have to agree on the final report. It\u2019s unclear when it will come out.    Updated at 1.24pm GMT     12.30pm GMT       Morocco expects new batches of coronavirus vaccine to arrive soon from Russia, South Korea and China, allowing it to continue its rapid immunisation rollout despite a pause in exports from India, a health ministry official said. Reuters reports:  Morocco has already received 8.5m doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, made in India, and Sinopharm vaccine, made in China, allowing it to administer more jabs than any other African country.  It expects 4.2m more doses soon, said the health ministry scientific committee member, Said Afif, keeping it on track to reach its target of herd immunity before the summer.  These include 2m more Sinopharm doses, 1m of Russia\u2019s Sputnik V shot and another 1.2m AstraZeneca doses made in South Korea and bought through the Covax vaccine-sharing scheme, Afif said. The health ministry has approved the use of the Sputnik and South Korean-made AstraZeneca vaccines. \u201cMorocco is adopting a strategy of anticipation to ensure the vaccination campaign continues steadily regardless of the delays announced by the AstraZeneca manufacturer in India,\u201d Afif said.     Updated at 12.46pm GMT     12.17pm GMT       Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said he had reminded China\u2019s foreign minister that Turkey expects to receive 50m doses of vaccines from Sinovac Biotech following a deal between the two countries during talks in Ankara. Reuters reports:   Turkey has until now been using Covid-19 jabs developed by Sinovac, received as part of an agreement to procure a total of 100m doses, and has administered 14.6m shots, with 8.2 million people having received a first dose, since 14 January, when the nationwide rollout began.  On Thursday, Turkey said it has begun initial talks to procure Russia\u2019s Sputnik-V shot.  Erdogan said he had told the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, that Turkey had not received the 50m doses by the end of February as pledged in the agreement and was therefore expecting them.  He said Wang told him he would bring the issue up with China\u2019s president.    Updated at 12.46pm GMT     12.07pm GMT       Iran expects to start domestic production of Russia\u2019s Sputnik V vaccine in April, the RIA news agency cited the Iranian ambassador to Moscow as saying.  Iran approved Sputnik V for domestic use in January, and says it has received more than 400,000 of the 2m doses it ordered from Russia, Reuters reports.    Updated at 12.18pm GMT     11.57am GMT       Europe\u2019s drug regulator said South Korean drugmaker Celltrion\u2019s Covid-19 antibody treatment may lower hospitalisation rates but it could not reach a conclusion on its benefits, Reuters reports. However, the treatment, regdanvimab, can be considered for treating patients at high risk of getting severely ill, the European Medicines Agency said. It added a rolling review of the treatment for European authorisation is still ongoing.       11.45am GMT       The German government has said it would be open to using the Russian-made Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine when approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), AFP reports. \u201cEMA approval - which Sputnik does not yet have - would provide the opportunity to use the vaccine in inoculation campaigns in Europe, and it would then also be worth considering for Germany,\u201d said chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s spokesperson Steffen Seibert. He refused to be drawn over France\u2019s accusation against Moscow of using the jabs as a \u201cpropaganda\u201d tool.        11.33am GMT       The Philippines reported 9,838 coronavirus cases on Friday, marking the highest daily jump since the pandemic began.  It comes as the World Bank warned that vaccinations needed to be a priority to limit further deaths and support the country\u2019s health system. Reuters reports:   A recent spike in infections has forced authorities to widen tighter restrictions in the capital Manila to surrounding provinces, but once-a-day religious services with up to 10% of a church\u2019s capacity will be allowed in the week ahead of Easter.   The Philippines, which is facing the second worst outbreak in Southeast Asia after Indonesia, has seen record new cases in three of the past five days, while infections reported in the past 10 days accounted for a tenth of its total 702,856 cases.  Deaths have increased to 13,149, after 54 more casualties were recorded on Friday, the health ministry said. The capital region accounted for two-fifths of the Covid-19 cases.       11.18am GMT       Norway is expected to decide by 15 April over the use of AstraZeneca\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said.  The rollout was suspended after several younger inoculated people were hospitalised, some of whom later died.    Updated at 11.30am GMT     11.11am GMT       Brazil\u2019s Butantan biomedical institute has developed a potential Covid-19 vaccine and on Friday will ask for regulatory approval to begin human trials, two sources told Reuters.  The potential new vaccine, Butanvac, was first reported by Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo.  The sources said Butantan plans to test the vaccine on 1,800 volunteers over two phases and it expects to start production in May. The vaccine will be 100% developed in Brazil by an international consortium.  Vietnam and Thailand are part of the consortium, Folha reported.    Updated at 11.31am GMT     10.42am GMT       In France, the health authority has said that dentists and vets should be granted permission to administer coronavirus vaccines as France\u2019s supply of doses is due to increase next month.  Reuters reports:    The Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9 (HAS) said in a statement that the health ministry had asked it to recommend how to bring new categories of health staff into the vaccination campaign urgently. \u201cThe growing supply of doses will allow vaccination at a larger scale from April and will require the mobilisation of a greater number of competent professionals to quickly vaccinate the relevant people,\u201d the HAS said. Dentists and pharmacists should be authorised to give shots in vaccination centres as well as in their own surgeries, while in vaccination centres medical students, lab technicians, veterinarians and certain other health professionals should also be authorised to administer the vaccines, the HAS said. Widening roles in this way would add about 250,000 medical staff to the vaccination drive.       Updated at 10.58am GMT     10.36am GMT    Germany could see up to 100,000 new cases a day, warns expert    In Germany, the president of the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases has warned that there could be as many as 100,000 new coronavirus infections a day in Germany if the spread of the coronavirus is not curbed, Reuters reports.  \u201cOf course, it could be 100,000 per day,\u201d Lothar Wieler told a weekly news conference. This comes after reports that Germany will classify France as a high-risk zone for Covid-19, according to Angela Merkel, in a move that could see Berlin tighten border controls and require mandatory quarantine to enter the country. The RKI warning also follows a government U-turn on a planned Easter shutdown that would have seen shops and churches closed over a five-day period.

This is just a day after the country reported 34,151 cases, which was a daily record for new cases at the time.  On Thursday, the Polish government said that new coronavirus restrictions would be imposed on Saturday, and were expected to last for two weeks, until 9 April. They include:  Limits to the number of people in churches. The closure of DIY and furniture shops, and stricter limits of people in shops and post offices. Nurseries to be closed. The closure of salons and hairdressers. The closure of sports centres except for professional athletes.

Reuters reports:   The prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, said the government planned to limit the number of shoppers allowed in shops from the weekend, while possibly keeping shops open longer in the evening. The decisions will be published on Saturday. Orb\u00e1n said it was hard to predict when the third wave of the pandemic \u2013 which swept the region fuelled by the spread of the more contagious variant of the virus first discovered in Britain \u2013 would peak. He said the main question was how fast infections would start dropping once the peak was passed. \u201cThe next 1-2 weeks will be hard,\u201d he told state radio.He added, though, that there was a \u201crealistic chance\u201d of schools reopening from 19 April, once teachers and staff have been vaccinated. Orb\u00e1n said by now, 71% of those aged above 65 years who have registered for a shot have been vaccinated, and a total of 1.8 million people got at least a first dose of a vaccine in the country of 10 million.

As always, if you would like to get in touch you can reach me via email or twitter: @tobithomas_  Thanks in advance!        6.59am GMT    Summary     EU leaders have given a lukewarm response to plans by the European commission to potentially block vaccine exports to highly vaccinated countries. In a statement issued after the EU virtual summit late on Thursday, the leaders failed to offer their support for the commission approach, instead saying they backed \u201cglobal value chains\u201d and reaffirmed that \u201ccompanies must ensure predictability of their vaccine production and respect contractual delivery deadlines\u201d. The EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, advocated support for the plan to block vaccine exports if necessary: \u201cWhile remaining open, the EU needs to ensure Europeans get a fair share of vaccines,\u201d she tweeted. Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, said while the EU had to \u201cprovide [for] our own population\u201d the bloc would not damage the supply chains necessary for the production and distribution of vaccines. France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, used a press conference after the meeting to criticise the British media: \u201cEvery day, when I read the press across the Channel, they make a case against us saying that it is the EU that is being selfish. This is false!\u201d he said. Germany is expected to declare France a high-risk zone for coronavirus on Friday. It comes as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 21,573 to 2,734,753, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Friday. In England, more than 40,600 people have been likely infected with coronavirus while being treated in hospital for another reason, raising concerns about the NHS\u2019s inability to protect them.  Joe Biden announced he had doubled his administration\u2019s vaccination goal to 200m shots during his first 100 days as president (up until 29 April). Australia on Friday reported its first locally acquired coronavirus case in more than a week, prompting authorities in Queensland to place restrictions on hospitals, retirement homes and disability centres. Moderna has delayed the shipment of 590,400 doses of its vaccine that were due to arrive in Canada this weekend, the federal procurement minister said on Thursday. Colombia has approved emergency use of Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s one-shot Covid-19 vaccine, the director of food and drug regulator Invima said as part of a government address on Thursday.      Updated at 10.16am GMT     6.51am GMT    Germany to classify France as a high-risk zone    Reports say Germany will classify France as a high-risk zone for Covid-19, the chancellor, Angela Merkel, said, in a move that could see Berlin tighten border controls and require mandatory quarantine to enter the country. Agence France-Presse says the decision will come into force on Friday and be announced by the national health institute, the Robert Koch Institute, according to the newspaper FAZ. Covid-19 incidence rates, which measure the number of infections in every 100,000 people over the previous seven days, have crossed the threshold of 200 in numerous French departments. In \u00cele-de-France, the region which encompasses the capital of Paris, it has passed 600. \u201cWhile we see such a high incidence it is simply a necessity ... a practically automatic process,\u201d Merkel told a press conference in Berlin on Thursday as part of an EU summit focused on the fight against Covid-19. \u201cIt is not related here to a political decision but when we see the evolution of the incidence rate \u2013 as is the case here \u2013 exceed the threshold of 200 for a long time, that requires a classification as a zone of high risk,\u201d she added. Up until now, only France\u2019s border area of Moselle had been classified by Germany as a high-risk zone. The classification imposes several travel restrictions, including a requirement to obtain a negative test result before entering German territory, 10-days quarantine, as well as the imposition of strict border controls. Berlin has also placed Austria\u2019s Tyrol state and the Czech Republic in the same category. But Merkel hinted on Thursday that France could enjoy special treatment and avoid strict border controls, despite being classified as a high-risk area. \u201cThere is a whole specific test procedure ... that is in discussion with France,\u201d she said. The French secretary of state for European affairs, Cl\u00e9ment Beaune, \u201cis negotiating the easing of terms ... to avoid the border being closed\u201d, AFP has learned from his entourage in Paris.

In one in five hospitals at least a fifth of all patients found to have the virus caught it while an inpatient. North Devon district hospital in Barnstaple had the highest rate of such cases among acute trusts in England at 31%. NHS England figures also reveal stark regional differences in patients\u2019 risk of catching the virus that causes Covid-19 during their stay. Just under a fifth (19%) of those in hospital in the north-west became infected while an inpatient, almost double the 11% rate in London hospitals. Doctors and hospitals claim that many of the infections were caused by the NHS\u2019s lack of beds and limitations posed by some hospitals being old, cramped and poorly ventilated, as well as health service bosses\u2019 decision that hospitals should keep providing normal care while the second wave of Covid was unfolding, despite the potential danger to those receiving non-Covid care. \u201cThese heartbreaking figures show how patients and NHS staff have been abysmally let down by the failure to suppress the virus ahead of and during the second wave,\u201d said Layla Moran MP, the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on coronavirus.

Updated at 7.36am GMT     6.13am GMT       Reuters is reporting that Australia is considering diverting Covid-19 inoculations from its vaccination programme to Papua New Guinea (PNG) where the coronavirus is threatening to unleash a humanitarian disaster, citing a government source. PNG is due to get 588,000 doses of vaccine by June under the COVAX initiative to help poorer countries but doubts have arisen about those supplies given new restrictions imposed in producing countries as the virus spreads. The European Union is implementing tougher vaccine export controls and has yet to respond to an Australian request that it release 1 million doses of AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine that has been contracted to go to Australia, to PNG instead, the source told Reuters. There is growing concern that PNG, an island nation of about 10 million people, many living in impoverished, isolated communities, can\u2019t afford to wait.  In the capital, Port Moresby, exhausted doctors have been warning sceptical patients that Covid is real. The country reported 351 new cases on Tuesday, bringing the the total to 4,109, an increase of more than 3,000 cases in just over a month. But there are concerns the true rate of transmission is far higher and masked by low testing rates. You can read our full story on the unfolding crisis in PNG below.   Related: Inside the Covid unit: crisis threatens to overwhelm PNG's biggest hospital         5.20am GMT       The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 21,573 to 2,734,753, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Friday.  The reported death toll rose by 183 to 75,623, the tally showed.       3.49am GMT    Moderna delays Canada vaccine shipment over 'backlog' in quality assurance process\u201d    Moderna has delayed the shipment of 590,400 doses of its vaccine that were due to arrive in Canada this weekend, the federal procurement minister said on Thursday. Moderna informed Canadian officials that the delay was due to a \u201cbacklog in its quality assurance process\u201d, Anita Anand said, adding that the company assured the remaining doses will be shipped no later than Thursday next week. Canada was set to receive 846,000 doses from Moderna this week, of which 255,600 were delivered on Wednesday, a government source told Reuters. \u201cOnce Moderna\u2019s final quality assurance process has been completed, the doses will be released for shipment.\u201d Anand said the US drugmaker gave assurance that the issue was a \u201cminor hiccup\u201d and it would not impact the shipment of 855,600 doses set for the week of 5 April. Canada has received 5.9 million vaccine doses so far, and expects to get 3.2 million next week, including from Pfizer Inc , AstraZeneca Plc from the United States and the rescheduled Moderna shipment. The country is facing a potential third wave of infections as the more transmissible B.1.1.7 virus variant first discovered in the UK drives outbreaks in some hotspots. It has 38,922 active cases at present and reported 5,202 new cases, as of 25 March.       3.18am GMT       Britain\u2019s Daily Telegraph reports that UK government is planning to implement a mass testing regime for lorry drivers arriving home, just days after the Prime Minister flagged tougher measures to prevent Covid-19 variants being transmitted from Europe. Hauliers, border force officials and other specialist workers at the border have been exempted from testing, but The Daily Telegraph reports that could soon change. The newspaper says Whitehall will announce this weekend that those previously exempted will instead have to take a customised test, though this will be done once they are in Britain rather than at the border to avoid delays that might lead to shortages in supermarkets. Those staying longer than two days will have to have a test within 48 of arriving and then every 72 hours, with fines similar to the 2,000 penalties for travellers who fail to test during home quarantine. This would mean three tests on days two, five, and eight, at one of the 39 testing sites across the UK. The paper says it will be enforced \u201cthrough fines similar to the \u00a32,000 penalties that travellers face if they fail to test on days two and eight during home quarantine. Ministers may give industry seven days to prepare amid concerns over the risk of disruption to trade.\u201d       2.25am GMT    Australia reports first locally acquired case in a week    Australia on Friday reported its first locally acquired coronavirus case in more than a week after a 26-year-old man tested positive, prompting authorities to place restrictions on hospitals, retirement homes and disability centres. The person who contracted the virus has been infectious for a week but stayed mostly isolated at home since Monday after developing symptoms, Queensland state Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said. Visitors will be banned in hospitals and retirement homes in state capital Brisbane starting Friday as authorities urged the city\u2019s residents to wear masks indoors and when using public transport. \u201cI hope we don\u2019t need to have more restrictions, but it just depends what unfolds over the next 24, 48 hours,\u201d state chief health officer, Jeannette Young, told reporters. Health alerts have been issued for shopping centres, an Italian restaurant and supermarkets exposed to the virus as officials rushed to trace the source of the infection. Snap lockdowns, social distancing rules and speedy contact tracing systems have helped Australia to contain fresh clusters. It has reported just over 29,200 cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began.       1.32am GMT    Colombia approves Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine    Colombia has approved emergency use of Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s one-shot Covid-19 vaccine, the director of food and drug regulator INVIMA said as part of a government address on Thursday. \u201cIn its capacity as regulator, INVIMA has authorised the emergency use of the vaccine from the pharmaceutical company Janssen, of the multinational Johnson &amp; Johnson,\u201d INVIMA director Julio Cesar Aldana said during the government\u2019s nightly broadcast. In addition to being a one-dose vaccine, the J&amp;J vaccine has less demanding storage needs than some other approved vaccines, Aldana said. Colombia has also closed agreements for vaccines developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech, AstraZeneca , Moderna, and Sinovac. It is also set to receive doses via the World Health Organization-backed COVAX mechanism. The government has reached an agreement to buy 9 million doses of J&amp;J\u2019s one-shot vaccine. The country has recorded over 2.35m cases of coronavirus and more than 62,500 deaths. It has administered more than 1.38mvaccine doses.       1.15am GMT    Biden doubles US vaccine target    In his first press conference as president, Joe Biden, announced he had doubled his administration\u2019s vaccination goal to 200m shots during his first 100 days as president (up until 29 April). \u201cI know it\u2019s ambitious, twice our original goal, but no other country in the world has even come close to what we are doing,\u201d Biden said of his new goal. More than 85 million people in the United States had received one shot by midweek this week and more than 46 million people had been fully vaccinated. The federal government is already on track to exceed 200 million shots shipped more than a week before Biden\u2019s 100th day in office even if it fails to significantly boost US vaccine production.  The government was putting around 2.5m shots in arms per day as of last week and has already administered 133m doses in the United States.       12.56am GMT       The virtual EU summit has seen the leaders back \u201cglobal value chains\u201d rather than support Brussels in using new powers to block Covid jab exports to highly vaccinated countries, writes the Guardian\u2019s correspondent in Brussels, Daniel Boffey.  The commission increased its scope on Wednesday for blocking exports to countries with a better record than the EU in vaccinating its population, or those that restrict exports through law or in their contracts with suppliers. The EU regulation, in force since January, previously only took into account whether a supplier was fulfilling its contract with the EU. In an attempt to garner explicit support for the move, the commission president, Ursula Von der Leyen, disclosed to the leaders that 77m doses made by producers in the EU had been shipped to 33 countries since 1 December. Of those, 21m went to the UK, of which just over 1 million were from AstraZeneca, with the rest supplied by Pfizer. \u201cWhile remaining open, the EU needs to ensure Europeans get a fair share of vaccines,\u201d she had tweeted. But in a post-summit statement, the leaders failed to offer their support for the commission\u2019s decision to take new powers allowing it to potentially block exports to countries with high vaccination rates or where governments blocked shipments through law or their contracts with suppliers: \u201cWe underline the importance of transparency as well as of the use of export authorisations,\u201d the joint statement said. \u201cWe recognise the importance of global value chains and reaffirm that companies must ensure predictability of their vaccine production and respect contractual delivery deadlines.\u201d There was also some anger towards the UK from the French president, Emanuel Macron, at the post-summit press conference; \u201cEvery day, when I read the press across the Channel, they make a case against us saying that it is the EU that is being selfish. This is false!\u201d he said.

Before we kick off, here\u2019s a summary of the main news so far:   EU leaders appear to have given a luke-warm response to plans by the European Commission to potentially block vaccine exports to highly vaccinated countries. In a statement issued after the EU virtual summit, the leaders failed to offer their support for the commission approach, instead saying they blacked \u201cglobal value chains\u201d and reaffirmed that \u201ccompanies must ensure predictability of their vaccine production and respect contractual delivery deadlines.\u201d EU Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen advocated support for the plan to block vaccine exports if necessary: \u201cWhile remaining open, the EU needs to ensure Europeans get a fair share of vaccines,\u201d she tweeted. Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, said while the EU had to \u201cprovide [for] our own population\u201d the bloc would not damage the supply chains necessary for the production and distribution of vaccines. France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, used a press conference after the meeting to criticise the British media: \u201cEvery day, when I read the press across the Channel, they make a case against us saying that it is the EU that is being selfish. This is false!\u201d he said. Joe Biden has doubled his vaccine goal in his first 100 days in office, saying he wants 200m jabs to be administered in that time.  Brazil has recorded more than 100,000 daily coronavirus cases and nearly 3,000 daily deaths, as the Covid crisis continues to escalate. Mexico\u2019s Covid-19 death toll topped 200,000 on Thursday, making it the third country in the world to reach the devastating milestone as the country struggles with its vaccination rollout. Under the global Covax scheme, Iraq is set to receive 336,000 doses of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine on Thursday. Turkey has begun initial talks to acquire the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine, the health minister Fahrettin Koca said on Thursday. The minister added that the capital, Ankara would receive a total of 100m doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of May. An epidemiologist from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health told a briefing that while newly vaccinated people had a right to celebrate, they should act as if they are unvaccinated until two weeks after their second dose. The UK\u2019s emergency coronavirus rules will continue for another six months. Romania battles a surge of Covid-19 infections that threatens to overwhelm its hospitals, as the government announces that Easter celebrations are planned to go ahead.     Updated at 1.01am GMT  ", "Australian aged care homes need $621m more a year to reach 'basic standards' [2020-08-26T17:30:30Z]": "An extra $621m per year is needed to lift all aged care homes in Australia up to \u201cbasic standards\u201d, according to research conducted for the aged care royal commission. The research found \u201cthere\u2019s not a lot of fat to trim\u201d in a system already \u201cconstrained by funding\u201d, and singled out for-profit aged care facilities as being the least likely in the sector to provide the best quality of care to older Australians. The damning findings come as the federal government and the aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, continue to weather intense criticism of their handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in the sector. The research, led by the University of Queensland, relied on on five years of financial data and care quality indicators including resident satisfaction and care needs that were developed by the University of Wollongong.   Related: Victoria's aged care Covid toll is devastating. Forget the blame game, we need answers | Gay Alcorn    According to the paper, state government run facilities and small-sized homes with 15 beds or less are the most likely to deliver the best quality of care, but major discrepancies remain. Of Australia\u2019s best quality aged care homes, 24% are state government-owned homes, 13% are not-for-profit facilities and 4% are for-profit homes. Of aged care facilities rated as providing the best quality of care, 41% are homes with one to 15 beds, while 17% are homes with 31-60 beds and just 5% are homes with 61-120 beds. The research estimates providers would need to spend an extra $3.2bn per year in total for Australia\u2019s entire aged care system to shift to the smaller home model to achieve a sector-wide high-quality standard. \u201cFunding levels might need to be much higher than the estimates ($621 million) if the Australian community and the Royal Commission aspire to achieve a higher quality in the future than facilities have achieved historically,\u201d the UQ paper says. Research author Associate Professor Tracy Comans told Guardian Australia \u201cin terms of efficiency of the sector we\u2019re finding there\u2019s not a lot of fat to trim\u201d, with total cost efficiency found to be 88% in the aged care system. \u201cThe [state] government-run nursing homes are less constrained by staffing issues and costs, as they have access to additional funding from their respective state, but the other providers don\u2019t have that extra funding,\u201d she said, noting other providers rely on federal funding and fees. The funding estimates follow an earlier research paper submitted to the royal commission in July, which showed Australians strongly support increasing government funding for universal access to high quality aged care. A majority of the 10,000 surveyed \u2013 none of whom engaged with any aged care service \u2013 felt the government should double its spending on aged care, from 4% of income tax collected to 8%. This week, Labor has repeatedly used question time to pursue the government over its handling of the aged care sector, which has been ravaged in Victoria\u2019s second wave of the coronavirus. More than 300 Victorians associated with aged care have died from the coronavirus thus far. On Wednesday, the opposition quoted Liberal MP Russell Broadbent who told Guardian Australia this week that aged care is a \u201cdisaster waiting to happen\u201d because \u201cprofit became more important than care\u201d. Broadbent said he had warned his government about this but was \u201ccompletely ignored\u201d. The opposition aged care spokeswoman, Julie Collins, accused the prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Wednesday of cutting funding to aged care.   Related: Aged care has been failing for years \u2013 coronavirus has merely highlighted systemic problems | Sarah Russell    \u201cEven before Covid-19 hit aged care, almost 200 nursing homes across the country were on the brink of closure after Scott Morrison cut $1.7bn from aged care as treasurer,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t fix aged care by cutting it.\u201d Collins also called on the prime minister to sack Colbeck from his role as minister, after he was unable to tell a Senate select committee into Covid-19 how many aged care residents had died from coronavirus. On Monday, a report into the Covid-19 outbreak at Sydney\u2019s Newmarch House was released, which found that a lack of staff, plus confusion about which state or federal government health authority had decision-making power to send infected residents to hospital, contributed to the 19 resident deaths. Earlier this week, the aged care royal commission criticised the Morrison government for failing to establish independent monitoring and reporting of aged care quality outcomes. The commission has previously heard the federal government did not have a plan for responding to Covid-19 outbreaks in aged care, a claim Morrison and health bureaucrats denied.", "Queensland Farmers' Federation boss's denial of science sparks call to suspend reef grants [2019-11-16T19:00:45Z]": "The Queensland Farmers\u2019 Federation\u2019s newly elected president once called Great Barrier Reef science \u201cunsubstantiated scaremongering\u201d, which has prompted calls for the suspension of the organisation\u2019s reef foundation grants. The peak body for Queensland farmers, the QFF manages water quality improvement grants from the Great Barrier Reef Foundation totalling $4.6m \u2013 among the most awarded to a single organisation under a controversial $443m federal funding deal. Its new president, Bundaberg cane grower Allan Dingle, recently sought to cast doubt on the consensus science that farm pollution is harming the reef. \u201cMuch of the science being used to justify the attempted regulation of our region is more about funding for a particular belief, it lacks science and is backed up instead by some dodgy modelling,\u201d Dingle, who is the chair of Canegrowers Bundaberg, wrote in that organisation\u2019s newsletter this year. \u201cThe Bundaberg sugar industry does not accept without question the science provided to justify the claims made and will not accept guilt for a crime that we have not committed.\u201d Dingle has this week backed away from those statements \u2013 including some made just three months ago \u2013 and told Guardian Australia they do not represent the views of the QFF or its members. Some farmers say they are concerned his elevation could damage an already strained relationship with the Queensland government after a bruising debate about water quality regulations that veered into science denial and conspiracy. Dingle introduced the contrarian scientist, Peter Ridd, at an event in Bundaberg in August and helped to promote the talk by saying: \u201cCane farmers are being pushed to the wall by overregulation based on unsubstantiated scaremongering around the Great Barrier Reef, and Ridd is setting the record straight.\u201d   Related: Climate-sceptic academic seeks $1.5m in donations to fight unlawful dismissal appeal    In Senate estimates last month, federal bureaucrats revealed they had written to Queensland Canegrowers \u2013 of which Dingle is a board member \u2013 using \u201cstrong wording\u201d to seek clarification about whether the organisation was \u201cconflicted\u201d by promoting Ridd\u2019s speaking tour while also managing Great Barrier Reef Foundation grants. Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson said Dingle\u2019s appointment was a \u201cconcerning development\u201d and that further reef foundation grants to the QFF should be paused. \u201cThe foundation shouldn\u2019t be giving public money to any recipient who is not fully committed to environmental outcomes based on the best available science,\u201d Whish-Wilson said. \u201cThe foundation should put on hold any further grants to the QFF until the foundation is satisfied that the QFF are fully committed to restoring and advocating for the best health of the reef.\u201d An overwhelming majority of experts say the Great Barrier Reef is at risk from pollution by agricultural chemicals. A recent study revealed the extent of controversial pesticides found in the reef catchment. The debate about reef regulations ultimately highlighted stark differences in approach among the agricultural sector. Cane growers\u2019 groups and AgForce, which represents pastoralists and grain producers, attempted to undermine the science. Many other farming organisations took the moderate position that there were flaws in the regulations but did not dispute the science or the need to play a role. The QFF\u2019s position acknowledges that climate change is the clearly greatest threat to the reef, but that runoff from farming is a problem that requires increased efforts.\u201cQFF does not question that land-based runoff remains a problem and that efforts must be increased if we are going to meet the ambitious targets set by governments,\u201d former CEO Travis Tobin said in September.It is understood the QFF has sought to reassure some of its member groups that Dingle will cut his association with Canegrowers Bundaberg and the Bundaberg Regional Irrigators\u2019 Group and now toe the organisation\u2019s policy line. Dingle said in a detailed statement that he was in the process of stepping down from various board positions since he was confirmed as QFF president on Thursday. \u201cThe comments referred to were made in my capacity as the chairman of Canegrowers Bundaberg, not as president of the Queensland Farmers\u2019 Federation and therefore do not represent the views of QFF or its industry members. \u201cQFF\u2019s position on the Great Barrier Reef and natural resource management has been, and remains, that a sustainable and profitable Queensland agriculture sector is essential to the longevity and prosperity of our sector and the environment.\u201d Some in the sector remain unconvinced. One north Queensland farmer who alerted Guardian Australia to Dingle\u2019s election said the situation threatened QFF\u2019s ability to represent a diverse sector and to lobby on behalf of members. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to go to government and get a deal out of them for farmers. How can they take him seriously given what he\u2019s said?\u201d he said. \u201cOn the reef regs we couldn\u2019t negotiate with [the Queensland government] because of the way these groups just dismissed the studies and said there was no evidence there was a problem. That cost us a better deal, there\u2019s no doubt about it. \u201c[Dingle\u2019s elevation to QFF president] is not a good signal really that the industry\u2019s main body thinks he\u2019s the person to represent them. Farmers can\u2019t talk to government. We need the QFF to do that for us. And I really question whether he\u2019s appropriate to be leading that.\u201d", "Labor warns some universities face collapse as international enrolments plummet [2020-04-02T16:30:55Z]": "Tanya Plibersek has called on the Morrison government to provide low-cost loans and guarantee universities\u2019 funding, warning some are at risk of collapse due to falls in international enrolments during the Covid-19 crisis. Ahead of the education minister, Dan Tehan, taking a support package to cabinet to be announced as early as next week, Plibersek told Guardian Australia that there are \u201cnow serious concerns that without federal government action some leading institutions could collapse\u201d. Universities, many of which rely on international students for more than a third of their revenue, are currently engaged in cost-cutting including asking staff to use up leave and instituting hiring freezes.   Related: Australian universities change admissions as coronavirus disrupts education    But representatives of the sector have played down the risk, with Universities Australia chief executive, Catriona Jackson, insisting they are \u201cnot asking for a bailout\u201d from government, only \u201csupport to help us weather the period ahead\u201d. Labor wants the government to provide universities with certainty by guaranteeing \u201cproper funding for Australian students\u201d, including paying at least the commonwealth grant scheme funding for the next three years based on projected student numbers before the 2019 budget. Plibersek also proposes \u201clow or no-cost loans to provide stability in coming months\u201d. \u201cAustralian universities are under immense pressure,\u201d she said. \u201cFor years, universities have used income from international education to help fund their world-leading research. \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic, and global travel restrictions, have led to a crisis in this funding model, with income from international students plummeting over recent months. \u201cAustralia cannot afford to let our universities fall off a cliff. The federal government must act now to shore up our universities.\u201d In addition to employing almost 260,000 people, Plibersek cited universities\u2019 role in developing new treatments, cures and equipment and educating doctors, nurses and health experts, as reasons to support them. \u201cThey are absolutely critical to dealing with this urgent health crisis \u2013 and will be just as critical to our recovery in the years to come,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the federal government fails to act now, some universities could collapse, which would see vital research cut, thousands of jobs lost, and leave students hanging in the middle of degrees.\u201d   Related: Morrison reminds us nothing lasts forever \u2013 especially the coronavirus spending spree | Malcolm Farr    Group of Eight universities tend to derive the most revenue from international students, although are considered very unlikely to fail due to their large asset bases.

Jackson said that Universities Australia has \u201cbeen talking with government since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic about ways to best support university students and staff, research and teaching, and have greatly appreciated the collaborative approach\u201d. \u201cUniversities are not asking for a bailout,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cRather we are seeking government support to help us weather the period ahead, and come out the other side able to play our part in economic and community recovery.\u201d Luke Sheehy, executive director of the Australian Technology Network group of universities, said he \u201canticipates the government will consider additional funding for [the sector], and that would be welcome\u201d. \u201cWe hope that it will allow us to look after students and staff, and continue to conduct vital research including to combat Covid-19.\u201d Sheehy noted universities would feel the greatest impact in the second semester, when international students from the northern hemisphere begin studies in Australia.

In the past two weeks Mayfair 101 has been advertising its investment products as a way to \u201ckeep ahead financially\u201d, but has also begun indefinitely delaying up to 60 outstanding property settlements in Mission Beach, which neighbours Dunk Island, citing its inability to pay due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) has been investigating marketing material pumped out by companies in the Mayfair 101 group for two years, the federal court has heard. In submissions to the court, lawyers for the Mayfair 101 group and its founder, James Mawhinney, said that Asic wanted to \u201cwarn investors about the high risk of investing in these products\u201d.   Related: Coronavirus restrictions tipped to send Australian house prices tumbling    Asic\u2019s governing legislation allows it to issue warning notices if it thinks investment laws might have been broken and investors are likely to suffer. But during a hearing on Thursday afternoon, held by phone hook-up due to the virus crisis, counsel for Mayfair 101, Sam Hay SC, said Asic\u2019s proposed decision was unreasonable and his clients had not been given a proper opportunity to respond to the regulator\u2019s concerns. He said Asic had not taken account of material put on Mayfair 101\u2019s website on Wednesday that included a warning that the group was not a bank and investments in its products \u201cmay therefore be seen to have a higher risk relative to a bank term deposit\u201d. Judge Jonathan Beach said Asic\u2019s complaints about Mayfair\u2019s promotional output did not appear to relate to material published after the end of 2019. He ordered Asic to give Mayfair 101 48 hours notice before publishing any warning so that the company has time to come back to court with any objections. In advertisements in News Corp newspapers last Wednesday, Mayfair 101 said the coronavirus outbreak, the bushfires and an abundance of cheap capital meant that \u201cthe RBA has little choice but to cut interest rates further in 2020\u201d. \u201cOur recent investment in Mission Beach and Dunk Island is \u2026 providing a bright future to a community that has been neglected for nearly 10 years,\u201dit said in the full-page advertisement. Two days earlier, Mainland Property Holdings, a $2 Mayfair 101 group company, began postponing property settlements in Mission Beach. . In several cases, the settlement was called off less than 24 hours before it was due. In a letter obtained by Guardian Australia, sent to Mission Beach residents whose property sales to Mayfair had not settled, a solicitor tells them \u201cthe coronavirus pandemic has impacted the ability of my client to fulfil its obligations under the contract\u201d. The solicitor says this is \u201cdue to the unprecedented and unexpected tightening of credit markets\u201d. \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic has disrupted the normal function of the Mayfair 101 group [and] forced the group to adjust its forecasts for the group\u2019s liquidity profile and implement capital prudency plans to protect its investors.\u201d   Related: Coronavirus jobs fallout: at least 35,000 workers stood down in three days as businesses reel    Documents obtained by Guardian Australia indicate Mayfair 101 entered into contracts to settle on 68 properties at Mission Beach between March 16, when the letter was sent, and August. The outstanding financial commitments on those settlements are more than $50m. The company has exercised a \u201cmaterially adverse event\u201d clause under the contracts it negotiated with sellers, many who had not had offers on their properties for years. Under the terms of the clause, which is usually used in large acquisitions or project financing transactions, settlement can be delayed indefinitely without breach of the contract. In a statement published on Tuesday last week, Mayfair said it had suspended \u201csettlements of a selected number of properties\u201d. It is unclear how many of the 68 outstanding transactions are affected, though a large tranche had been scheduled to go through last week. Guardian Australia understands the suspended transactions include some of the best-positioned beachfront properties. Several now-desperate property sellers in Mission Beach have told Guardian Australia they had made financial commitments \u2013 including obtaining bridging finance to purchase property elsewhere \u2013 on the basis of their contracts with Mayfair. Two families said they had sent most of their belongings to near Brisbane preparing to move; one had sold their mattress to a friend and had to ask for it back. \u201cPeople have cleared pantries, fridges and freezers, so at this time when buying food has become difficult, they are left with an empty house and no supplies,\u201d one resident said. \u201cThe fact they\u2019ve pulled the plug so late is going to cause huge problems. It\u2019s a very divided community, a lot of people have said they\u2019re desperate for investment, but if people are hurt in the process patience will wear thin.\u201d It is understood some have sent letters of demand to Mayfair, insisting they proceed with settlement or release property owners from their contracts. Bonny Bauer, a resident running in council elections on Saturday, said people had placed \u201ca lot of faith in Mayfair\u201d, partly because they had the strong backing of the local council. \u201cI do think sentiment is starting to turn,\u201d Bauer said. \u201cIt\u2019s the entire community that will be losing out because of this.\u201d In its statement, Mayfair says it has settled more than 130 properties and that the suspension of some settlements was a \u201cprudent measure\u201d until the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic passes. \u201cThe Mayfair 101 Group remains committed to finalising our purchases and continuing with our development plans for Mission Beach,\u201d it said. \u201cWhen we embarked on this journey over six months ago, we said it would take \u2018time, patience and perseverance\u2019, and the community needs to be mindful of the challenges being posed on the health and financial systems globally. \u201cThe group has the support of some significant investors who consider our strategy in Mission Beach to be timely given the desire for people to live in lower-density regions. Ultimately an increase in domestic tourism is inevitably going to benefit Mission Beach and we are already fielding enquiries from people wanting to buy land on Dunk Island.\u201d Mayfair 101 did not respond to questions about whether it had the capital to fund outstanding settlements, or whether new investors were now required to meet those longstanding commitments.   Related: Queensland miners fear Fifo workers could pose a threat during coronavirus pandemic    It also did not respond to questions about whether its full-page advertisements were misleading, given a solicitor for Mainland had written to property owners claiming the coronavirus pandemic had \u201cdisrupted the normal function\u201d of the fund. \u201cWe see the Covid-19 situation as a short hiatus that will pass due to the Australian government\u2019s isolation initiatives aimed at curbing the spread of the virus,\u201d the statement said. In an application filed with the federal court, Mayfair 101 said Asic informed it about the impending warning notice last Tuesday. Asic\u2019s draft notice said it was also concerned that the types of investments the Mayfair 101 group was making \u201cmay not be aligned with the promises to investors,\u201d Mayfair 101 said in its court application. The regulator gave Mayfair 101 until 5pm on Friday to respond, but told the company it \u201cdoes not negotiate the content of public warning notices\u201d. After a flurry of legal correspondence, Asic extended the deadline for a response to midday on Wednesday. However, Mayfair 101 had already launched legal action after lodging paperwork with the court on Tuesday. During the hearing on Thursday afternoon, Mayfair 101\u2019s counsel, Hay, unsuccessfully tried to convince Beach that the application contained confidential information and should not be provided to media including Guardian Australia. However, the court had already provided the document to Guardian Australia.", "Morning mail: coronavirus death toll climbs, Klobuchar drops out, Adam Goodes on racism [2020-03-02T20:14:28Z]": "Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 3 March. \nTop stories \nThe global death toll for coronavirus has now exceeded 3,000, with more than 90,000 infections recorded.

Central Queensland University will set up a new school of mines and manufacturing at their campuses in Gladstone and Rockhampton, if the Coalition wins government on Saturday 18 May. The university will launch new courses and degrees related to the mining industry, and will construct brand new buildings, new facilities and new equipment. A new school of mines will be created in Rockhampton, and a new manufacturing training centre created in Gladstone, according to the plan. In a press release, Morrison said this would not only support the mining sector, but would also train people in emerging industries like hydrogen. Hydrogen can be used to store energy generated by renewables like solar and wind.

Morrison, who hopped off the plane from the United States following his official visit and on to another one to visit a drought-stricken Queensland community to announce a further $100m in drought funding, said Joyce had done his job and the issue had been \u201cover-analysed\u201d. \u201cWell Barnaby, when I appointed him to this role, provided constant reports I mean, I didn\u2019t ask him to write a book, I asked him to give us some advice on what he was hearing from farmers and that is what he did, and he did that through quite a bit of correspondence with me, and regular meetings with me and he presented all of that to cabinet,\u201d he said, while batting away flies in Dalby.   Related: Labor calls for release of drought envoy reports Barnaby Joyce says he sent via text    \u201cAnd that was his job. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be an author and a publisher, it was candid feedback from drought-affected communities around the country, and he did his job and he did it well and I thank him and so I think people are getting a bit caught up in the semantics of a final report. \u201cThere were many reports, I can assure you of that, as there was from the national co-ordinator general, and we are working our way through that for a response to his suggestions as well. So I think people have over analysed that issue.\u201d According to his own travel records, Joyce spent less than three weeks on the ground in drought-affected communities outside his own electorate while engaged as the prime minister\u2019s special envoy on drought, including charging tax payers $2,600 for a charter flight to open a machinery field day, 300km from Melbourne. After David Littleproud confirmed he could not provide the parliament with Joyce\u2019s report, as requested by Labor, as \u201che did not prepare a final report, and as such, no document exists,\u201d the opposition went on the attack, declaring Joyce\u2019s role to be a farce. Joyce angrily defended his work, and said he had sent regular text messages to the prime minister reporting what he had found. That seemed to surprise Morrison, who responded to a journalist\u2019s question asking about the text messages with \u201cwell, you said text message, not me, I said he wrote to us, he presented reports . ..\u201d before pivoting when told it was Joyce who had referred to text messages. \u201cWell he did,\u201d Morrison said, barely skipping a beat. \u201cAnd Barnaby is a master of all forms of communication. He spoke to me on the phone, he spoke to me in my office, he presented to cabinet, he wrote me letters about this issue, which is what I asked him to do, so it was a pretty comprehensive set of advice that we received, and I was happy to receive it and it has informed much of what we have done.\u201d Morrison would not say when any information on what Joyce reported would be provided, saying it was part of the normal processes of any other cabinet document. He said the parts of the additional drought package announced on Friday were crafted following Joyce\u2019s advice, including the extension of the drought communities program, and additional funding for rural financial councillors and addressing weeds and pests, adding \u201cI would say he was pretty optimal\u201d. The additional drought funding was timed for Morrison\u2019s arrival back in the country, with the prime minister having made reference to his Queensland trip in his final press conference in the US, in response to a question about what he had learnt about America during his visit.

The latest changes aim to continue to simplify the process, which enables assistance to be paid to eligible farmers, at the Newstart rate. Another $33m of the latest package will extend the drought community support initiative, which sees charities, including St Vincent de Paul and the Salvation Army, provide emergency financial support of up to $3,000 to eligible farmers. Charities are often used during natural disasters to administer funds, to ensure the money is provided as quickly as possible. The number of local government areas able to access federal government assistance for infrastructure, including for water, as well as provide mental health support for residents, was also increased. Anthony Albanese said while the latest support from the government would be welcomed by communities it was \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d, from Morrison. \u201cHe cut $3.9bn from the Building Australia Fund, and now he\u2019s announcing that $100m of that $3.9bn is to be brought forward,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cWe said at the time that [drought] legislation was being debated \u2026 that the $100m per year should not start in a year\u2019s time. It\u2019s not like the drought has just happened, it has been here for years, under this government\u2019s watch and this is too little too late. But we welcome any assistance for our farming community. They\u2019re doing it tough and it\u2019s about time the government recognise that and act.\u201d   Related: Barnaby Joyce took $2,600 charter flight to stand alongside Nationals candidate at regional show    The National Farmers\u2019 Foundation did welcome the government\u2019s announcement, but said communities needed a \u201cnew approach\u201d, repeating its calls for a national drought policy. \u201cWe need a comprehensive and enduring national approach to drought that focuses on preparedness and resilience measures.

This is deeply, deeply unhelpful \n   People are not at fault - they are never at fault in this situation, so let\u2019s be extremely careful here, it\u2019s really really important that we don\u2019t attach unnecessary stigma to this. \n   \n  He added that the case in which a British businessman inadvertently infected at least 11 people was by no means a \u201cmassive \u2018super spreading\u2019 event.  \n   \n   This is an unusual event and it is a wake-up call because there may be other circumstances in which this disease can spread like this, so we need to study those circumstances for sure, but it doesn\u2019t change our overall assessment. \n   \n  \n \n \n  4.26pm GMT  \n  \n  The latest coronavirus figures show that 1,018 people have died from the infection, with over 43,000 cases worldwide.  \n  All but one death has been in China, the World Health Organization director general said in a press conference.  \n  Outside China, there have been 393 coronavirus cases across 24 countries. \n  \n \n \n  4.23pm GMT  \n  \n  The Church of England could suspend the sharing of chalices during communion because of coronavirus. \n  The church is \u201cmonitoring the situation closely and taking advice from the relevant medical authorities\u201d, James Newcome, bishop of Carlisle, told the C of E\u2019s ruling body, the general synod, meeting in London. \n  He reminded the synod that during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, the church advised clergy to suspend chalice sharing and urged churches to post notices about hygiene.  \n  \u201cIf the situation continues to get worse, that sort of [advice] will certainly be issued,\u201d he said.  \n  The Catholic church in England and Wales has issued guidance to priests which includes asking people with cold and flu symptoms to refrain from taking communion from the chalice and for all members of congregations to use hand sanitisers. \n  But it stopped short of suggesting the chalice to be withdrawn, or the sign of peace -

The health secretary said: \n   \n   The NHS has the capability now to cope with the very highest level of intensity and isolation with 50 cases and the capability to expand that to 500 cases and to do that without an impact on the wider work of the NHS.  \n   But of course, if the number of cases get bigger, then we will need to take further steps and as he knows from his time in my shoes, there are extensive plans already in place for how that should happen if we reach that eventuality. \n   \n  Conservative MP for the Vale of Clwyd, James Davis, asked for a likely timescale for the development of a vaccine and how much Britain has contributed to that. \n  Hancock responded that \u201cestimates vary\u201d on when a vaccination will be available. \n   \n   We\u2019ve put \u00a340m into the both global and domestic efforts to find a vaccine and work is under way fast and that work is progressing, but the time taken not just to develop a vaccine but also to ensure that it is assured and that it is safe to use, it does take time.  \n   \n  \n \n \n  2.40pm GMT  \n  \n  Birmingham Live is reporting that a British man who contracted coronavirus while on his honeymoon on a Japanese cruise ship expects to be released from hospital later this week. \n  Alan Steele, 58 and from Tettenhall in Wolverhampton, tested positive for the virus while on the Diamond Princess ship with his new wife Wendy. He posted on Facebook that had been symptom-free since he was moved to hospital last Thursday. He said: \n   \n   Doctor has given me the set plan of action for my discharge and as long as I pass the tests I will be free on Friday. Would have been Thursday but Japan on holiday tomorrow so no one to do the test results. \n   Heard bad news on more cases on ship but possible good news is all will now be tested so if you\u2019re free of virus they should let you go. \n   \n  \n \n \n  2.05pm GMT  \n  \n  Responding to Hancock, the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said Labour supported the government\u2019s move to extend powers to quarantine people.  \n   \n   I understand why the secretary of state has invoked the regulations, as he is entitled to do under the public health act. He has our support. Quarantine arrangements must be seen to be necessary, proportionate and in accordance with law, and enforcement of those quarantine arrangements, including the powers of restraint where necessary, must be fully transparent and the rights and freedoms of the quarantined [people] must be fully understood so as to ensure they are treated with dignity and respect. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.06pm GMT \n \n \n  1.58pm GMT  \n Health secretary: \u201cThe situation will get worse before it gets better\" \n  \n  The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been giving a statement to parliament on the new powers the government has given itself to allow it to force people into quarantine if they suspect they have coronavirus. \n  He described it as a \u201cbelt and braces\u201d approach to protecting the public. \u201cThe powers are proportionate and will help us slow down transmission of the virus, make it easier for NHS and public health staff to do their jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe clinical advice about the risk to the public has not changed and remains moderate\u201d. \n  He added: \u201cDealing with this disease is a marathon, not a sprint. The situation will get worse before it gets better. We will be guided by the science. Be in no doubt, we will do everything that is effective to tackle this virus and keep people safe.\u201d \n  \n Updated at 2.07pm GMT \n \n \n  1.23pm GMT  \n  \n  The diagnosis of four people living in a single apartment block in Hong Kong has prompted worried comparisons with the deadly Sars pandemic of 17 years ago. \n  Medical workers in full protective suits went to Hong Mei House in Tsing Yi district on Tuesday, evacuating more than 100 people in 34 apartments. \n  Health officials said it was a precautionary measure after a 62-year-old woman was diagnosed with the virus on Tuesday. She was living 10 floors below a man who was earlier confirmed with the virus.  \n  The woman\u2019s son and daughter-in-law, who live with her, were among seven new cases reported, raising the city\u2019s tally to 49.  \n  As in 2003, officials suspect the building\u2019s plumbing may be to blame. The people evacuated were living in the 34 apartments vertically above or below the woman, and share the same sewage system.  \n  A modified toilet drainage pipe in her unit may have spread the virus and officials disinfecting the building are checking if any other units have made such alternations. \n  Authorities sought to assuage fears of an epidemic, dismissing similarities to the Sars outbreak at the Amoy Gardens housing estate in 2003. More than 300 people were infected and 42 people died after a defective sewage pipe in the apartment block was believed to have caused the vertical spread of Sars. \n  Most of Hong Kong\u2019s 7.4 million population live in high-rise apartments. \n  \n Updated at 1.39pm GMT \n \n \n  1.07pm GMT  \n  \n  A number of scientific experts have clarified the \u201csuper-spreader\u201d term used to describe the man who infected 11 others with coronavirus after contracting it in Singapore.  \n  \u201cThe issue with the term \u2018super-spreader\u2019 is that it implies that the person in question is inherently more able to pass on disease compared with others,\u201d said Dr Stephen Griffin, associate professor at the University of Leeds and chair of the virus division of the Microbiology Society. \n  He said the ability of an individual to pass on the disease depended on a number of factors:  \n   \n   For example, a patient that is very unwell, coughing without practising good hygiene, and who is then stuck in a crowded lift for an hour, is far more likely to spread infection to multiple recipients compared with someone that self-isolates at the first sign of symptoms. \n   \n  Meanwhile, Brendan Wren, a professor of microbial pathogenesis at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \n   \n   There is no clear evidence that individuals with the new coronavirus can be \u2018super-shedders\u2019 or \u2018super-spreaders\u2019. It is likely that individuals may have mild symptoms prior to unwittingly transferring the virus.  \n   \n  Griffin said that while it had not yet been confirmed clinically, there was increasing anecdotal evidence to suggest the virus can be passed on prior to the onset of symptoms. \n  \n Updated at 1.41pm GMT \n \n \n  12.53pm GMT  \n  \n  Thousands of people have been ordered into quarantine in the Chinese city of Tianjin after a cluster of new coronavirus cases were linked to one department store, the New York Times reports.  \n  Nearly a third of the 102 new patients in Tianjin worked or shopped at a department store in the Baodi district, or had close contact with employees or customers, according to the city\u2019s health authorities. \n  In the city of more than 15 million people, 70 miles southeast of Beijing, officials estimated 11,700 customers visited the unidentified shopping complex during a period in late January.  \n  The authorities said those customers would be quarantined, and the department store would be sealed and disinfected. \n  Emergency measures have been imposed in some areas of the district, home to nearly 1 million people, including road blocks and round-the-clock security patrols. \n  Meanwhile, an apartment building in Hong Kong has been evacuated and dozens of residents quarantined after two people living on different floors were found to be infected with the virus. \n  The cases suggest the virus spread through the building, perhaps through a pipe, raising further fears of the virus\u2019s ability to spread.  \n  \n Updated at 1.04pm GMT \n \n \n  12.28pm GMT  \n  \n  The Chinese financial news website Caixin is reporting on new research which suggests that the incubation period for the coronavirus is as long as 24 days rather than the previously believed 14 days. \n  The study \u2013 which is based on data gathered from more than 1,000 coronavirus patients in China \u2013 also found that fewer than half of the patients showed fever symptoms when they first saw doctors.  \n  The researchers from Chinese hospitals and medical schools, led by Zhong Nanshan, found that relying on signs of fever to identify the virus in its early stages could result in large numbers of infected people going undiscovered. Fever occurred in just 43.8% of patients, but later developed in 87.9% following hospitalisation.  \n  \n \n \n  12.09pm GMT  \n  \n  We would like to hear from Guardian readers in the UK: how are you responding to these warnings?

He also claimed the council had instructed local elected representatives not to talk to journalists. \n   \n   I think they have not been straight with everyone from the start and have intentionally hid the implications of the infections. We don\u2019t know who in the city has been exposed and where. \n   I am finding details about incidents from newspapers days after they have happened. We should have been informed since day one. \n   You have people who are \u2018self isolating\u2019 but could still be going to the shops.

However, in light of the members of staff who tested positive for coronavirus in Brighton we\u2019d like to remind the public that it is vital that any patient who thinks they may have symptoms does not try to attend a GP appointment or hospital emergency departments in person.

Economies in Emerging Asia look most vulnerable, as do firms operating in both the tech and electronics sectors\u201d. \n  He says that the bounce back in the stock market since initial falls caused by concerns about the virus made sense because investors were right to expect central banks to keep interest rates low and therefore underwrite asset prices. \n  But the global economy was still walking a tightrope between \u201crates remaining low enough to support current asset valuations and economic growth on the one hand, and markets being able to allocate capital efficiently in a world of continued low rates on the other. The longer it goes on, the more difficult the balancing act will become\u201d \n  He concludes:  \n   \n   The fallout from the coronavirus remains the biggest challenge facing the global economy over coming months and, as things stand, it is unclear how events will play out. But the market response to the virus reveals a deeper vulnerability at the heart of the global economy. The current goldilocks environment of low but positive growth and low interest rates justifies the high valuation of asset prices. But the longer it continues, the greater the risk that it sows the seeds of the next major economic downturn. \n   \n  You can read more on how the outbreak might impact the world economy here: \n   \n    Related: Will the coronavirus outbreak derail the global economy?  \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.31am GMT \n \n \n  2.23am GMT  \n  \n  In terms of travelling to China, Greg Hunt, says the advice to Australians remains: \u201cdo not travel to China\u201d.  \n  \n \n \n  2.22am GMT  \n  \n  Brendan Murphy is being asked if we should expect the number of infected passengers on the cruise ship in Japan to rise.

As the minister said also, our risk population is people who have come from China fromFebruary 1. Not people of Chinese background. People who have come from China, whatever their background is. And we are very concerned about xenophobia and any sort of racial profiling which is completely abhorrent. We\u2019re talking about a relatively small number of people just because of where they\u2019ve been, not who they are. There is no community transmission of this virus in Australia. We have not seen any case of sustained transmission at all in this country. There is no reason for people to be wearing masks.

The organisation\u2019s public funding \u2013 for measures to reduce pollution flowing to the Great Barrier Reef \u2013 has been called into question after the group began promoting lectures by the controversial academic Peter Ridd, who argues farm run-off is not damaging the reef.   Related: State government-funded managers urge cane farmers to question reef science    The overwhelming scientific consensus, supported by governments and the foundation, is that water quality is one of the most significant threats to the health of the natural wonder. In April, the foundation awarded $1.4m to Canegrowers \u2013 one of the first grants issued under its $443m partnership with the federal government \u2013 to continue a program managed by external behavioural consultants called Cane Changer. Cane Changer is partly designed \u201cto improve recognition\u201d of growers \u201cfor their long history of environmental stewardship\u201d and the organisation has said the program will \u201cset the record straight\u201d. It also works with farmers to promote voluntary \u201cbest management practice\u201d measures. The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson has this week written to the foundation to question the award of the grant. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning       \u201cHow is it that the foundation has given a grant to improve water run-off to an organisation that is now involved in a speaking tour questioning whether run-off matters?\u201d Whish-Wilson asked. \u201cI am writing to ask you what steps the foundation takes to ensure that the recipients of grants are not supporting or involved in activities that aim to discredit the scientific community or promote the denial of anthropogenic climate change. \u201cHas or will the foundation terminate this grant and take steps to recover funds already granted? \u201cIt is paramount that the foundation do everything it can, and be seen to be doing everything it can, to support the scientific community and defend the evidence regarding the impact of climate change and agricultural run-off on the reef.\u201d The foundation\u2019s managing director, Anna Marsden, said it funded \u201corganisations that contribute to \u2026 collective efforts to save the reef. \u201cFunds have been provided to Canegrowers to support on-ground work with cane farmers to encourage positive change and stewardship, with the goal of improving land management practices and ultimately reducing pollutants going to the reef,\u201d Marsden said.   Related: Sugarcane farmers label scientific consensus on reef 'unsubstantiated scaremongering'    \u201cThe grant continues a successful project previously funded by the Queensland government. \u201cThe use of funds by Canegrowers is closely accounted for, with all funding required to be used solely for the ultimate purpose of improving the water quality of the reef.\u201d Canegrowers says its statewide organisation manages state and federal grant funding and \u201cremains committed to managing the impact of farming on the waterways that feed into the Great Barrier Reef\u201d. It says district branch companies have made individual decisions about promoting or supporting Ridd\u2019s controversial lectures. The speaking tour coincides with a likely vote in Queensland parliament this month on reef regulations, which would set pollution limits for sediment and chemical discharge from farms into the reef catchment. \u201cCanegrowers is very concerned that the provisions within the reef bill currently before the Queensland parliament will act as a disincentive to growers continuing with the excellent engagement they have given to water quality and farm practice improvement programs by implying that no matter what they do, it will never be enough and the goalposts will keep on shifting,\u201d the organisation said in a statement. \u201cThe campaign against the reef bill is against the ramping up of the existing regulations on cane farming, adding more bureaucracy with no clear benefit to growers or water quality.\u201d The state environment minister, Leeanne Enoch, defended the measures this week and said they were based on scientific advice. \u201cFor the last decade, the Queensland government has supported agricultural industries to voluntarily improve their practices. However, uptake has not been fast enough, so water quality has continued to decline.\u201d", "Labor costings reveal budget surplus of $21.7bn by 2022-23 [2019-05-10T05:51:07Z]": "Labor has released its costings, showing a bigger budget surplus every year and culminating in a $21.7bn surplus by 2022-23, as a result of changes to the \u201ctwo-class tax system\u201d. Labor released the Parliamentary Budget Office costings a week out from the election, with its process independently approved by three senior financial accounting experts to rebut the Coalition\u2019s claims that Labor\u2019s big policy offerings were unfunded. The release of the costings was the focus of Friday\u2019s campaigning, as Scott Morrison visited Michelle Landry\u2019s seat of Capricornia, trying to shore up one of the Coalition\u2019s most marginal seats in Queensland. Bill Shorten discussed health and funding for the Great Barrier Reef in Cairns, in Warren Entsch\u2019s seat in Leichhardt, though he spoke to media before the release of the costings. Labor has promised the $21.7bn surplus, which equates to 1% of GDP, four years earlier than the Coalition. Labor\u2019s costings provide for future tax cuts when the tax-to-GDP ratio hits 23.4%, equivalent to the figure under the Howard government.   Related: Scott Morrison pledges $30m to fund new mining school in Queensland    The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the budget surpluses, which are more than twice as large as the Coalition\u2019s by 2022-23, were made possible by closing down and reforming tax loopholes and concessions that \u201coverwhelmingly benefit high wealth individuals\u201d. \u201cAustralia has a two-class tax system,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cIf your income comes from a certain place, you have good accounting advice, you get access to the first-class tax system. \u201cIf you are a normal payer, it is the very basic deductions, economy class, for you. We are reforming the tax system. These reforms raise $154bn over the next decade.\u201d But Labor\u2019s costings do not include any future increase in the Newstart unemployment benefit even though Labor has flagged a review. An Acoss proposal to lift the payment by $75 a week would cost the federal budget $3.3bn a year, and simultaneously lift consumer spending according to Deloitte. The Business Council has also urged an increase to Newstart. Bowen rejected suggestions it should have been included in the costings document, saying Labor had not committed to a \u201cparticular increase\u201d. \u201cThe choice between the Australian people is the government, who says, \u2018No problem, nothing to see here, we\u2019ll keep it the same\u2019, and us who say there are legitimate issues,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think there are issues with Newstart. But we\u2019re not going to the election promising a quantum of an increase, and so it\u2019s not reflected here, and nor should it be.\u201d Bowen also rebutted questions over the final cost of Labor\u2019s climate transition, which may be required as industries continue to adjust, saying \u201call those costings are there\u201d. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said there was a \u201cbig black hole\u201d in Labor\u2019s costings, for the failure to account for the increase in spending promised with changes to Newstart, to foreign aid, to research and development. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement by the Labor party leaves a big, black hole and doesn\u2019t explain the negative economic impact that $387bn of higher taxes will have on the economy,\u201d Frydenberg said. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said a $75 a week increase would cost $39bn over the next decade while Labor\u2019s promise to restore the full growth in hospital funding would cost $33.7bn over the decade. Cormann said Australia was facing global economic headwinds, which were exacerbated by droughts and floods. \u201cIf Labor agrees with us that there are some global economic headwinds ahead of us and we have to deal with some downside risks in the economy, why do they believe that imposing $387bn in higher taxes and probably more is the right prescription for the economy,\u201d Cormann said. But Bowen made a virtue of former Liberal treasurer Peter Costello\u2019s views on tax relief to contrast with the Coalition\u2019s promise of tax cuts to raise the 19% tax bracket threshold from $41,000 to $45,000 from 2022, then flatten tax brackets from 2024. \u201cWhen the budget returns to sustainable surplus, that is when tax relief can prudently and sensibly been delivered,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cI agree with Peter Costello, it should be delivered term by term, budget by budget.\u201d Labor has used the Coalition\u2019s budget as a baseline even though Labor described the 2019 Budget wage growth assumptions as \u201cheroic\u201d. Bowen said the Labor had led the policy debate and released the costings earlier than any opposition ever had prior to an election.

This is a very big issue,\u201d Cuomo said. \n  He said testing volume needed to increase tenfold and leaders needed to discuss how the federal government can help and what the states can do to make enough tests available. \n  \u201cThat is the issue for the country right now I think,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cIt\u2019s a benchmark - \u2018Where are we?

But the United Nations and aid groups have warned of a catastrophic outbreak should the disease spread among an acutely malnourished population. \n  The International Initiative on Covid-19 (IICY) said its first 34-tonne shipment will reach Yemen next week. It will contain 49,000 virus collection kits, 20,000 rapid test kits, five centrifuges and equipment that would enable 85,000 tests, and 24,000 Covid-19 nucleic acid test kits. \n  IICY was founded by the charity arm of multinational Yemeni family conglomerate Hayel Saeed Anam (HSA), Tetra Pak, Unilever, the World Bank-backed Yemen Private Sector Cluster, and the Federation of Yemen Chambers of Commerce and Industry. \n  \n \n \n  9.01pm BST  \n  \n  The South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has told the country he is optimistic, despite the current \u201cmoment of great peril\u201d, writes Jason Burke in Johannesburg. \n  In a national TV address, the former labour activist and businessman, announced a massive $26bn, \u00a321bn social and economic relief package and spoke of a gradual reopening of the economy as a strict lockdown nears the final week. \n  The tough measures imposed on 27 March have caused immense hardship to many people in South Africa, with tens of millions deprived of their livelihoods and without sufficient food.  \n  There has been growing tension in overcrowded poor neighbourhoods but the tough measures have effectively braked the spread of the disease and won plaudits internationally.

Ministers were not briefed by our mission in Brussels about the scheme and a political decision was not taken on whether or not to participate. \n   \n  The government\u2019s explanation has shifted repeatedly. \n  First, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said the decision not to take part was taken because the UK is no longer a member of the EU, despite that not precluding participation during the transition period. \n  Then Downing Street said it had missed out because a \u201ccommunication error\u201d meant it missed the deadline, despite UK officials having been present for numerous discussions about the scheme, and that it would be taking part after all. \n  On Tuesday, McDonald told MPs not taking part had been a political decision, before the health secretary insisted later the same day that that was not the case. Within hours, McDonald\u2019s latest statement has surfaced. \n   \n    Related: Matt Hancock forced to deny \u2018political\u2019 opt-out from EU ventilators  \n   \n  \n Updated at 9.06pm BST \n \n \n  8.31pm BST  \n  \n  Downing Street has weighed in behind the UK\u2019s health secretary, Matt Hancock, following a report that he is being lined up to take the rap for government failures over protective equipment testing. \n  Boris Johnson\u2019s official spokesman said the prime minister has full confidence in Hancock and stands behind his pledge to get the UK to 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of the month, despite only 19,000 being carried out on Monday. \n  However, a blame game has started in Whitehall about some of the problems that have dogged the government\u2019s reaction to the crisis, with Hancock\u2019s handling of the logistics around testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) in the spotlight. \n  At the same time, some government sources have been pointing the finger at Public Health England for slowness to increase testing, and the NHS for failing to refer enough staff, which means completed tests are well below capacity of more than 39,000. \n   \n    Related: Downing Street defends Hancock as blame game starts over PPE shortages  \n   \n  \n \n \n  8.16pm BST  \n  \n  In English football, third and fourth-tier clubs have agreed to open their books to provide evidence of the financial ruin the pandemic may cause in order to find a breakthrough in the talks with the players\u2019 union over wages. \n  Clubs have been asked by the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association to supply confidential information to independent accountants to show the scale of pay cuts potentially required.

He urged Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad to reduce that number \u201csince physical distancing and self-isolation in such conditions are practically impossible\u201d. \n  Buhari said inmates with no confirmed criminal cases against them, elderly prisoners and those who were terminally ill could be discharged. \n   \n   Most of these custodial centres are presently housing inmates beyond their capacities and the overcrowded facilities pose a potent threat to the health of the inmates and the public in general in view of the present circumstances, hence the need for urgent steps to bring the situation under control. \n   \n  \n Updated at 8.10pm BST \n \n \n  7.54pm BST  \n  \n  In Washington, an agreement has been reached on major elements of a near-$500bn (\u00a3406bn) aid package for small businesses, including additional help for hospitals and virus testing. \n  A Tuesday afternoon Senate session could provide an opportunity to quickly vote if the final deal comes together, the Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has said. \n  \u201cWe have a deal and I think we\u2019ll pass it today,\u201d Schumer told CNN.

Last month, the US state department summoned Cui to protest comments by Beijing suggesting the US military might have brought the virus to China, ratcheting up tensions between the global powers. \n  Meanwhile, Trump has said his government is trying to determine whether the coronavirus emanated from a lab in Wuhan, following reports the virus may have been artificially synthesised at a China state-backed laboratory or perhaps escaped from such a facility. \n  \n Updated at 7.14pm BST \n \n \n  7.00pm BST  \n Summary \n  \n   \n   At least 2.5 million people have now been infected with the coronavirus, researchers at Johns Hopkins University say, while more than 170,000 are known to have died worldwide. \n   UK hospital deaths rose by 823, according to the Department for Health and Social Care, taking the total to 17,337.

They write:  \n   \n   Several European countries are to relax coronavirus restrictions related to children, with Holland and France announcing that primary schools will reopen next month and Spain setting out how under-14s will be allowed out of the home from next week. \n   French children would return to school in staggered year groups, the education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, said, with no more than 15 pupils allowed in each class. \n   Primary pupils aged from five to 11 would be the first to go back on 12 May, one day after the end of a strict nationwide lockdown. The following week older children in selected years at secondary schools and lyc\u00e9e would return. All classes would be back by 25 May. \n   Blanquer said the aim was to have primary school children back in \u201csmall groups\u201d, probably of \u201cless than 10 pupils\u201d. The plan is likely to prove challenging for headteachers in public schools, where classes of 30-plus pupils are common. \n   \n   \n    Related: Lockdown eased: Netherlands and France plan to re-open primary schools  \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.08pm BST \n \n \n  5.59pm BST  \n  \n  Ryanair has told passengers they will have to wait until \u201cthe Covid-19 emergency has passed\u201d if they want a refund for a cancelled flight, writes Miles Brignall, Guardian money reporter. \n  Last month Europe\u2019s biggest budget airline was offering passengers on cancelled flights the option of a refund within 20 working days, via its website. \n  The airline has been forced to ground most of its fleet due to the pandemic, although it is still running a few flights in and out of the UK, mostly out of Dublin and Stansted. \n  Passengers were initially delighted, but a Ryanair email sent out on Monday, seen by the Guardian, has heralded an about-turn. \n  Instead of the refund, passengers have been sent a link telling them how told how to use its vouchers to purchase Ryanair flights and other services over the next 12 months. \n  Passengers can still request a cash refund, it states, but the request will be placed \u201cin the cash refund queue until the Covid-19 emergency has passed\u201d. \n  \u201cWe highly recommend using the refund voucher as these are readily available and you can book flights on all Ryanair Group airlines in over 200 destinations,\u201d says the airline. \n  Passengers who have tried to insist on the refund have told the Guardian that they have been left \u201cwaiting for hours to talk to a chatbot\u201d, and it is impossible to get it processed. \n  Ryanair said: \u201cFor any cancelled flight, Ryanair is giving customers all of the options set out under EU regulations, including refunds.\u201d \n  EU rules require the airlines to refund passengers on flights they cancel within seven days, but the airline industry across the board has ignored this over the last month, citing extraordinary circumstances. \n  EasyJet has since reintroduced the option of a cash refund online, while BA requires passengers to call the airline, which is near impossible at the moment. \n  The airlines can only offer credit vouchers with the consent of the passenger but this has not stopped the airlines and travel companies telling passengers, making this the only practical option.  \n  \n Updated at 6.10pm BST \n \n \n  5.51pm BST  \n  \n  France has become the first country to call publicly for Apple and Google to weaken privacy protections around digital contact tracing, after its government admitted that its current plans would not work without changes to smartphone operating systems, Alex Hern, the Guardian\u2019s tech editor, reports. \n  The criticism comes two weeks after a landmark collaboration between the two companies to build technology enabling digital contact tracing apps, which would track contacts between users in an attempt to help slow the spread of Covid-19. \n  The collaboration enables phones from both companies to work together, but also sets strict limits on what data can be sent back to public health authorities. It is those limits that France wants lifted, France\u2019s digital minister, C\u00e9dric O, said in an interview with Bloomberg News. \n  \u201cWe\u2019re asking Apple to lift the technical hurdle to allow us to develop a sovereign European health solution that will be tied our health system,\u201d O said. \n  Contact tracing apps that do not conform to the new privacy requirements can still be built, but they face strict limits, particularly on Apple phones. They don\u2019t work when \u201cbackgrounded\u201d, as when another app or game is in use on the phone, nor when the screen is locked entirely. \n   \n    Related: France urges Apple and Google to ease privacy rules on contact tracing  \n   \n  \n \n \n  5.39pm BST  \n Italy records first significant fall in infections \n  \n  Italy reported 534 new deaths from coronavirus on Tuesday, 80 more than on Monday, bringing the death toll to 24,648, Angela Giuffrida reports. \n  However, the number of people currently infected with the virus fell by 528 to 107,709 - the first significant fall since the outbreak began. \n  Italy\u2019s total cases to date, including victims and survivors, rose by 2,727 to 183,957. \n  Italy has been under lockdown since 9 March, with only some businesses, such as bookshops, and factories reopening over the past week. The quarantine is due to end on 3 May, after which restrictions will be eased. Prime minister Giuseppe Conte said on Tuesday a plan would be announced by the end of this week. \n  \u201cA reasonable forecast is that we will apply it from May 4,\u201d he said.  \n  \n \n \n  5.26pm BST  \n  \n  An online sale of face masks made by Japanese consumer electronics company Sharp saw such overwhelming demand that it crashed not only the site, but also the company\u2019s range of smart home gadgets across Japan, writes Guardian technology editor Alex Hern. \n  In common with many manufacturers worldwide, Sharp has pledged to use excess capacity in its factories to manufacture PPE, some of which is being sold direct to the public. At \u00a52,980 (\u00a322) for a box of 50, the face masks are good value, and Japan is experiencing a shortage nationwide, despite a long history of public mask wearing. \n  But when the masks went on sale, the initial stock of 3,000 sold out rapidly, according to Asahi Shinbun, and then the special site created for the sale collapsed, which also brought down the server controlling Sharp\u2019s smart home appliances, including smartphone-powered air conditioners. \n  According to Sharp, the same server was used to manage logging in to both sites, meaning that over-usage of one crashed both. \n  \u201cThe masks received a great response, and we apologise for the inconvenience. We are investigating the details of the cause,\u201d a Sharp spokeswoman said. \n  Almost one in six Japanese households have some sort of smart device, according to Statista, with comfort and lighting devices like those sold by Sharp the second most-popular category. The country\u2019s humid and hot summers make a remotely controlled air-conditioner a smart purchase for many \u2013 at least, until the server breaks entirely. \n  \n Updated at 5.27pm BST \n \n \n  5.19pm BST  \n  \n  Greek authorities have placed the town of Kranidi in the Peloponnese under curfew after a mass outbreak of coronavirus cases was detected among refugees being hosted in a holding facility in the area, Helena Smith reports from Athens.  \n  The lockdown was announced by Nikos Hardalias, the civil defence minister handling the government\u2019s response to the pandemic, who rushed to the region after it was revealed that 150 detainees and two employees at the site had tested positive for the virus.  \n  Local residents will be forced to remain indoors between 8pm and 8am for the next 14 days with health officials imploring the older generation not to leave their homes at all.  \n  The outbreak has alarmed authorities who ordered the facility - home to asylum seekers from Somalia and Sudan - be put in quarantine last Thursday.  \n  The curfew came as Greece\u2019s centre right government signalled the country would begin relaxing restrictive measures next week when land registry offices and courts of first instance reopen to the public, albeit partially, on April 27.  \n  Meanwhile, media outlets reported that Greece\u2019s death toll as a result of Covid-19 had risen to 120 after a 35-year-old man, with no underlying illnesses, and a 101-year-old woman, also succumbed to the disease. To date cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in three refugee reception centres, including Kranidi.  \n  Greek authorities have said they will begin transferring elderly and vulnerable refugees from overcrowded Aegean island camps to the mainland amid mounting concerns of the potentially lethal virus hitting facilities hosting in excess of 35,000 people on islands facing the Turkish coast.  \n  The nation, which marked Orthodox Easter over the weekend under strict lockdown, has fared better than most other EU states after the government announced tough preventative measures early on.  \n   \n    Related: Greece to use drones to stop crowds gathering for Orthodox Easter  \n   \n  \n \n \n  5.10pm BST  \n  \n  The \u0130stanbul Chamber of Physicians says that at least 2,000 healthcare workers in the city have been infected and nine have died, numbers far in excess of Turkey\u2019s official figures, reports Bethan McKernan, the Guardian\u2019s Middle East and Turkey correspondent. \n  The government\u2019s official figures, last updated on 2 April, put the number of sick healthcare workers at 601.  \n  Istanbul, Turkey\u2019s largest city with a population of 17 million, has around 60% of the country\u2019s total cases. Hospitals are generally more organised than in the chaotic few weeks of the pandemic but \u201cserious problems continue,\u201d a statement from the the union said on Monday. \n  The union says that at least 2,000 healthcare workers have been infected and nine have died in Istanbul alone. . \n  Reported fatalities across Turkey also remain much lower than other badly hit countries, at 2,140. However, analysis by the New York Times of death records in Istanbul shows that the city has seen a jump of 2,100 more deaths than expected in a recent four-week period, suggesting the coronavirus outbreak may be much worse than officials say. \n  Turkey is also not following WHO guidelines for recording data related to the pandemic, only counting cases that have been confirmed with a positive test result and excluding cases that have been clinically diagnosed as Covid-19 with no test administered.  \n  \n \n \n  4.57pm BST  \n  \n  The days of cheap air travel will be over if airlines are forced to introduce physical distancing measures on planes because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the industry has warned, reports Julia Kollewe. \n  Alexandre de Juniac, the director general of the International Air Transport Association (Iata), said that if governments ordered airlines to adopt physical distancing onboard aircraft, at least a third of seats would remain empty and airlines would have to raise their ticket prices by at least 50% or go bust. \n   \n   Either you fly at the same price, selling the ticket at the same average price as before, and you lose enormous amounts of money so it\u2019s impossible to fly for any airline, particularly low cost; or you increase ticket prices by at least 50% and you are able to fly with a minimum profit. So it means that if social distancing is imposed, cheap travel is over. \n   \n   \n    Related: Physical distancing will end era of cheap air travel, industry warns  \n   \n  \n \n \n  4.36pm BST  \n  \n  Singapore has reported 1,111 new confirmed cases of coronavirus, the second day in a row that it has reported more than a thousand new cases.  \n  Although the latest rise is several hundred short of Monday\u2019s - which at 1,426 was the biggest yet for the south east Asian city state - it will compound fears that the country\u2019s strict controls to curb the spread of the virus are increasingly ineffective.  \n  Nearly all - 1,050 - of the cases were among the dormitory-housed migrant workers that Singapore relies on to provide the city\u2019s essential basic services, the ministry of health said in its daily statistical release, adding that the large increase in cases was only now being picked up because of extensive testing.  \n   \n   Most of these cases have a mild illness and are being monitored in the community isolation facilities or general ward of our hospitals.

Today\u2019s increase is the second highest reported yet, after Sunday when authorities reported a rise of 6,060.  \n  \n \n \n  1.49pm BST  \n  \n  As the Netherlands announces plans to emerge from lockdown, its public health institute reported 729 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Tuesday, its lowest number of daily new cases since 23 March.  \n  The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) said there had been 165 more deaths, taking the country\u2019s total to 3,916. \n  Overall, 34,134 people in the Netherlands have tested positive for the coronavirus, of whom 9,897 were admitted to hospital.  \n  Earlier, Daniel Boffey, the Guardian\u2019s Brussels bureau chief, reported that the Dutch government was set to announce the reopening of some schools at the beginning of May.  \n  The easing of the country\u2019s lockdown comes after advice from the official scientific advisors, obtained by the Guardian, said the effective reproduction rate of the epidemic has been less than 1 in the Netherlands since 15 March. This means that one person with the disease infects fewer than one other person in the community. \n  \n \n \n  1.37pm BST  \n  \n  Iran has reported 88 more deaths from coronavirus in the past 24 hours, down from 91 the previous day.  \n  In a press conference broadcast on state TV, Kianoosh Jahanpoor, the health ministry\u2019s spokesman, also said that testing had confirmed 1,297 new confirmed coronavirus cases, taking the total in Iran since the outbreak began to 84,802, Tasnim news agency reports.  \n  The total death toll from Covid-19 in the country, the worst-affected in the Middle East, now stands at 5,297, Jahanpour said. So far 60,965 patients have recovered, but 3,357 remain in hospital in a critical condition.  \n  \n \n \n  1.28pm BST  \n  \n  The Pamplona bull run, where hundreds of daredevils play a risky game of catch-me-if-you-can with half-tonne fighting bulls, is the latest world-famous cultural event to be cancelled as a result of coronavirus, AFP reports.  \n  Pamplona\u2019s municipal council decided to call off the event, Spain\u2019s best-known bull running festival, held each year between 6-14 July, because \u201cthe fight against Covid-19 has become a global priority and there is no other possible option for such massive festivities,\u201d a statement said. \n  Sixteen people have been killed in the bull runs since officials began keeping track in 1910. The last death was in 2009 when a 27-year-old Spaniard was gored in the neck, heart and lungs. \n  The coronavirus has killed almost 21,300 people so far in Spain, the third-highest official toll after the US and Italy. \n  \n Updated at 2.24pm BST \n \n \n  1.18pm BST  \n  \n  Daniel Boffey, our Brussels bureau chief, has sent in the latest on plans in the Netherlands to ease the lockdown there.  \n  The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, is expected to announce that primary schools, child care settings and schools specialising in teaching children with special education needs will reopen in the first week of May. Rutte is due to hold a press conference at 7pm CET this evening. \n  According to advice provided by scientists from the country\u2019s centre for infectious disease control, the risk from an increase in infection from the reopening of some schools is deemed \u201cmanageable\u201d. \n  As of Monday, 33,405 patients in the Netherlands had tested positive with Covid-19, of which 9,779 persons were hospitalised and 3,751 died. \n  The leaked scientific advice, obtained by the Guardian, says the effective reproduction rate of the epidemic has been less than 1 in the Netherlands since 15 March. This means that one person with the disease infects fewer than one other person in the community. \n  Of all reported Covid-19 patients, the scientists advise that \u201cbarely 1% are under 20 years of age, while this age group accounts for approximately 22% of the entire population\u201d.  \n  The scientists advise: \u201cBy opening childcare, primary schools and special education, more transmission is expected among children and their parents. However, it is expected that this will not result in much additional care and hospital admissions.\u201d \n  The scientific advisers are not as one on whether primary schools should open completely or whether they should start with half-full classes. They suggest that the government takes into account the data over the next few weeks from Scandinavian countries where schools have already reopened. \n  Secondary schools in the Netherlands could reopen a month later \u201cif no outbreaks have occurred in [primary] schools in the intervening period\u201d. \n  They further advise that children up to 12 years of age should be allowed to recommence sports outside and without a requirement to keep 1.5-metre distance from each other. Older children will be required to maintain the social distancing rule. \n  Top class athletes may train outside but running clubs should not resume as they advise that clouds of sweat can be detected 20m behind a running athlete. \n  \u201cOn theoretical grounds, a risk would then arise for those in the slipstream, just behind the athlete,\u201d the scientists report.  \n  \n Updated at 2.25pm BST \n \n \n  1.03pm BST  \n  \n  This is Damien Gayle taking over the live blog now, keeping you up to date with the latest coronavirus news from around the world.  \n  If you want to get in touch with tips, suggestions or news from your part of the world, please send me an email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or you can reach me via direct message to my Twitter profile, @damiengayle. \n  \n \n \n  12.53pm BST  \n  \n  The coronavirus pandemic may be prompting some anti-vaxxers to question their views, experts say, but others are doubling down \u2013 and vaccine hesitancy, amplified by some celebrities, could seriously undermine a future inoculation programme. \n  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 70 candidate coronavirus vaccines are being developed, with three already in clinical evaluation. The world\u2019s small but vocal anti-vaccination community seems divided on how to respond. \n  \u201cThe extremists, the belief-driven groups who reject vaccination on principle, whose aim is to disrupt and polarise, they\u2019re not changing, in fact they\u2019re capitalising,\u201d said Heidi Larson, director of the London-based Vaccine Confidence Project (VCP). \n  You can read the full story here \u2013 \n   \n    Related: Coronavirus causing some anti-vaxxers to waver, experts say  \n   \n  \n \n \n  12.47pm BST  \n  \n  Projected deaths from coronavirus in Northern Ireland have been cut dramatically to 1,500, reports Henry McDonald in Belfast. \n  Earlier this month, medical chiefs in the region said the expected death toll would be more than 3,000. The health minister in the power sharing regional government, Robin Swann, said the latest, lower figure for deaths was due to new modelling on Covid-19 numbers. \n  While welcoming the lower projected death toll, Swann said there was \u201cno room for complacency\u201d and that the lockdown measures across Northern Ireland needed to continue.  \n  Appealing to the public to maintain social distancing, he added:  \n   \n   Thinking this is over or that the risk is diminishing will risk lives. So, don\u2019t be that person. Don\u2019t take that chance. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.03pm BST \n \n \n  12.38pm BST  \n  \n  Greek officials have signalled that they are preparing for the country\u2019s lockdown to be reversed. The government\u2019s spokesman, Stelios Petsas, has announced that as of 27 April the justice system will gradually return to normality with land registry offices and some courts opening \u201cfor specific procedures\u201d. \n  This will mark the first relaxation of restrictive measures since schools were closed in the western Peloponnese \u2013 which saw the country\u2019s first outbreak of the coronavirus \u2013 on 4 March.  \n  Sectors of the population less at risk will then follow, said Petsas, explaining that while small shops may open thereafter the government\u2019s priority would continue to be the protection of the most vulnerable.  \n  Greek health authorities said on Monday that 116 people had died from the disease in the country while 2,245 cases had been confirmed. Some 54,345 tests had been conducted nationwide.  \n  As in other parts of Europe, the transition is expected to be as tentative as it is gradual. \u201cWe are not there yet,\u201d Petsas insisted, noting that the detection of further infections in a refugee camp in Kranidi in the Peloponnese was particularly worrying.  \n  Nikos Hardalias, the minister for civil defence handling the government\u2019s response to the pandemic, has rushed to the holding facility where more than 150 Somali refugees are believed to have tested positive for the virus.  \n  \n Updated at 12.39pm BST \n \n \n  12.23pm BST  \n  \n  Turkey\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak has hit 90,981 cases, overtaking China to become the seventh most affected country in the world. \n  While Ankara took early steps to limit international travel and closed schools and restaurants shortly after its first case was confirmed on 11 March, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has resisted calls for a total lockdown, insisting that the wheels of the economy \u201cmust keep turning\u201d. \n  Turkey is still recovering from a 2018 currency crash. Further economic turmoil is likely to further dent the already waning popularity of the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP).  \n  Reported fatalities remain much lower than other badly hit countries, at 2,140. However, analysis by the New York Times of death records in Istanbul shows that the city has seen a jump of 2,100 more deaths than expected in a recent four-week period, suggesting the coronavirus outbreak may be much worse than official tallies.  \n  Fearful that people will try to take advantage of the sunny spring weather, Turkey has implemented a 48-hour weekend curfew until further notice. The start of Ramadan on Thursday will be marked by a new four-day lockdown during which families will not be able to travel to eat and celebrate together without risking fines or arrest.  \n  Turkish Airlines, the national flag carrier, has also announced a massive operation of 195 flights over the next nine days to bring back 25,000 Turkish citizens stranded abroad in time for the beginning of the holy month. Both international and domestic airports are otherwise closed.  \n  \n \n \n  12.12pm BST  \n  \n  Ruby Princess crew members clapped and cheered from their balconies as the first of their workmates finally began to disembark the troubled cruise ship in New South Wales to fly home. \n  At least 49 crew members from six countries disembarked from the ship, which has been docked at Port Kembla for more than two weeks following a Covid-19 outbreak. Police in New South Wales said more crew members will disembark in coming days, but hundreds will remain on board and return with the ship to its port of origin. \n  The Ruby Princess initially docked in Sydney in March, when the ship\u2019s passengers and some crew disembarked. It has since been linked to at least 21 deaths and hundreds of coronavirus cases across Australia. \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  12.00pm BST  \n Summary \n  \n   \n   Global deaths pass 170,000. More than 170,000 people have lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic so far, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. There have been more than 2.47 million cases worldwide. Just under a quarter of global deaths \u2013 42,000 \u2013 have been in the US. The UK has nearly 126,000 cases and more than 16,500 deaths. \n   Trump announces plan to suspend immigration to US. US president Donald Trump announced on Twitter that he will \u201ctemporarily suspend\u201d immigration to the US, referring to the \u201cinvisible enemy\u201d, a term he has used in the White House press briefings and on Twitter to refer to coronavirus. \n   World Health Organization says evidence that coronavirus came from bats. The WHO said all available evidence suggested the coronavirus originated in bats in China late last year and was not manipulated or constructed in a laboratory. Trump said last week the US was trying to determine whether the virus emanated from a lab in Wuhan in central China.  \n   Italy to announce plan to ease lockdown this week as confirmed cases fall by 20. The country\u2019s prime minister said the government would unveil plans for the gradual reopening from lockdown before the end of this week. Italy reported 454 new deaths from coronavirus on Monday, 21 more than on Sunday, bringing the death toll to 24,114. For the first time, the number of people who are infected fell by 20 to 108,237. \n   Singapore extends lockdown after second-wave rise in cases. Singapore, which has been lauded for its initial response to the outbreak, has seen a surge in cases, reporting a record 1,426 new coronavirus cases on Monday, mostly among foreign workers. The city state\u2019s prime minister announced a lockdown would be extended by four weeks until 1 June. \n    Denmark ban on gatherings of more than 500 in place until September. The country\u2019s government has announced it will not allow gatherings of more than 500 people until at least 1 September, and that the current ban on gatherings of more than 10 people will stay in place until 10 May. Denmark was one of the first European countries to introduce lockdown restrictions on 12 March, before it had recorded any deaths. Three hundred and 64 people are reported to have died in the country. \n   Oktoberfest cancelled. Bavaria\u2019s leaders have cancelled Oktoberfest, the world\u2019s biggest beer festival, due to fears that it could become a breeding ground for the coronavirus. The 210-year-old festival, which attracts 6 million visitors and brings in around \u20ac1bn a year, is a major event in the German calendar. \n   Oil price falls to historic low due to coronavirus. The US oil market collapsed into negative prices for the first time as North America\u2019s oil producers run out of space to store an unprecedented oversupply of crude left by the pandemic. However, Trump has downplayed the oil price drop, saying it\u2019s only \u201cshort term\u201d. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.15pm BST \n \n \n  11.52am BST  \n  \n  There was further unrest in the Paris suburbs, or \u201cbanlieues\u201d, on Monday evening, with fireworks fired at police and rubbish bins and cars set alight. Similar incidents were reported in areas of Strasbourg in eastern France. \n  This appears to be a spread of unrest following an incident in Villeneuve-la Garenne on Saturday evening in which a trail motorbike, ridden at speed by a man not wearing a helmet, hit the door of a police car stopped at a red traffic light. \n  An investigation is ongoing into the incident, which is the subject of conflicting claims: locals say officers opened the door of the unmarked police vehicle deliberately with the intention of injuring the rider, who was thrown from the bike and suffered a fractured femur. The man\u2019s family has announced it will sue the police, who deny the accusation its officers acted deliberately. \n  Seven people were arrested after the unrest on Sunday, which appears to have been sparked by rumours the injured man was so badly hurt he had his leg amputated; four were still in custody on Tuesday morning. \n  It has been reported in some UK media that the violence broke out because of French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s decision to extend the country\u2019s strict lockdown until 11 May, but this seems unlikely as the extension was announced several days before the unrest began. However, tensions in the banlieues are especially high because of allegations of heavy-handed policing of the lockdown in the densely populated housing estates, which are home to many migrant and minority communities. \n  In Strasbourg, rubbish bins and a car were torched and Molotov cocktails were thrown at a police station. The local authorities said images posted on social media looked dramatic, but there was limited damage to the buildings. \n  \n Updated at 12.08pm BST \n \n \n  11.44am BST  \n  \n  Here\u2019s more on the decision to cancel this year\u2019s Oktoberfest in Bavaria, from the Guardian\u2019s correspondent in Germany, Kate Connolly. \n   \n   Bavaria\u2019s leaders have cancelled Oktoberfest, the world\u2019s biggest beer festival, due to fears that it could become a breeding ground for the coronavirus. \n   The 210-year-old festival, which attracts around six million visitors a year, is a major event in the German calendar. \n   Markus S\u00f6der, the premier of Bavaria, which has been one of the regions worst hit by the pandemic in Europe, said the Oktoberfest posed too big a public health risk. He had hinted over several weeks that it was \u201con the rocks\u201d and was unlikely to take place.  \n   S\u00f6der said: \n   \n   \n   Living with coronavirus means living carefully. As long as there is no vaccination, we need to be very sensible. We are in mutual agreement that the risk is quite simply too high \u2026 compromises will not help. \n   \n   \n    Related: 'Bitter pill': Bavaria cancels Oktoberfest over fears of coronavirus spread  \n   \n  \n \n \n  11.32am BST  \n WHO: All evidence suggests coronavirus originated in bats \n  \n  The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that all available evidence suggests that the coronavirus originated in bats in China late last year and it was not manipulated or constructed in a laboratory. \n  US president Donald Trump said last week his government was trying to determine whether the virus emanated from a lab in Wuhan in central China. \n  WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a Geneva news briefing: \n   \n   All available evidence suggests the virus has an animal origin and is not manipulated or constructed virus in a lab or somewhere else. It is probable, likely, that the virus is of animal origin. \n   \n  She added that it was not clear how the virus had jumped the species barrier to humans but there had \u201ccertainly\u201d been an intermediate animal host.  \n  \n Updated at 11.41am BST \n \n \n  11.02am BST  \n  \n  In its first coronavirus briefing this week, Germany\u2019s leading public health body, the Robert Koch Institute, said there was evidence Covid-19 could damage the heart, kidneys and cause blood clotting. Prof Lars Schaade, the RKI\u2019s vice-president, said: \u201cWe must systematically examine all the evidence, including through autopsies.\u201d \n  He said the decision to relax restrictions across Germany, which has seen some small shops opening, and pupils returning to school to sit exams this week, were \u201csensible\u201d from a societal point of view. But from a purely epidemiological viewpoint restrictions should remain in place.  \n  The main aim remained ensuring the number of cases remained in a \u201csafe zone\u201d, he said. Germany\u2019s reproduction rate is 0.9 \u2013 up on Friday when it was 0.7 \u2013 which means every person contracting the illness is infecting a further person. The number of new cases are doubling every 20 days, the number of deaths every 12 days. \n  According to health authority figures this morning, Germany has more than 147,000 confirmed cases, and 4,912 people have died from the disease. Germany\u2019s mortality rate from coronavirus is at 3.2%. Schaade said it had risen, as the amount of infections and subsequent deaths in care homes and hospitals had increased. \n  He said test capacity was at 730,000 a week in Germany, but should ideally be around 1m, with everyone who has a respiratory illness or infection of the airway getting tested. However, he pointed to practical problems with upscaling testing due to a global lack of reagents. \n  Despite reports this morning that children are not spreading the disease as much as had been thought, Schaade said intensive tracking showed children who had contracted the disease in Germany were found to have as much of the virus in their throats as adults, even if they often show no symptoms. He said the RKI believed children played a not-insignificant role in spreading the disease. \n  Schaade said advice about stopping the spread of the virus remained the same, and would do so as long as there was no vaccination: keep a distance of 1.5 metres, cough into the elbow and wash your hands. He advised the wearing of face protection that covered the nose and mouth in public places. \n  He said intensive tracking of those who had been in contact with infected people remained an important part of the strategy to tackle coronavirus, and was a \u201cclassical epidemiological tool\u201d, enabling contacts to be \u201cfound and isolated so that they don\u2019t infect more people\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 11.37am BST \n \n \n  10.54am BST  \n Singapore lockdown extended until 1 June \n  \n  Singapore\u2019s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong has extended a lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus by four weeks until 1 June, after the city-state saw a sharp rise in cases. \n  The measures, which include the closures of most workplaces and schools, were initially set to run from 7 April until 4 May. \n  You can read the prime minister\u2019s full speech here.

Millions of people across Indonesia have been left with no income as a result of the economic crisis caused by the pandemic. \n  President Joko Widodo had previously stopped short of banning Mudik, instead urging people not to travel. On Tuesday, he announced a change in policy, citing a transport ministry survey that said roughly a quarter of Indonesians were insisting on joining the exodus after Ramadan in the world\u2019s biggest Muslim-majority country.  \n  It is feared that mass movement in the country of 264 million people would allow coronavirus to spread rapidly to areas of the country where health systems are far weaker.

Without the actions taken by his administration, there could have been 700,000 deaths, a million deaths, or maybe \u201cmillions\u201d, Trump said.  \n  As of today, there have been more than 41,000 deaths recorded in the US, or just under one in four deaths worldwide.  \n  A reminder that you can get in touch with me directly on Twitter @helenrsullivan.  \n   \n   The global number of deaths tops 169,595 with more than 2.47 million confirmed cases, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. \n   US deaths pass 41,000 \u2013 nearly a quarter of the global total \u2013 with infections at just under 783,290, or just just under a third of the world\u2019s total. \n   Oil prices fall to historic lows. The US oil market has collapsed into negative prices for the first time in history as North America\u2019s oil producers run out of space to store an unprecedented oversupply of crude left by the pandemic.  \n   US President Donald Trump downplays the oil price drop, saying it\u2019s only \u201cshort term\u201d.

WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus Tedros also said that easing restrictions is not the end of the pandemic. \n   Italy\u2019s confirmed cases fall by 20. Italy reported 454 new deaths from coronavirus on Monday, 21 more than on Sunday, bringing the death toll to 24,114. For the first time, the number of people who are currently infected fell by 20 to 108,237. Meanwhile, the total cases to date, including victims and survivors, rose by 2,256 to 181,228, the smallest increase since 10 March. \n   US scuppers G20 coronavirus statement on strengthening WHO. US hostility to the World Health Organization scuppered the publication of a communique by G20 health ministers on Sunday that committed to strengthening the WHO\u2019s mandate in coordinating a response to the global coronavirus pandemic. \n   The Spanish government is to propose that the European Union create a \u20ac1.5tn (\u00a31.3tn) fund to aid recovery in countries worst-hit by the coronavirus crisis, Spain\u2019s El Pais newspaper reported. Citing an internal document, the paper reported that Spain\u2019s prime minister Pedro Sanchez plans to make a formal proposal to his EU colleagues during a summit on Thursday. \n    Several countries began to ease their lockdown restrictions.

The Great Barrier Reef Foundation will announce on Monday that a 25-day health survey of remote parts of the reef by the Australian Institute of Marine Science is the first venture awarded money through the Reef Trust partnership set up by the government last year. The announcement comes after publication of an official audit last week that found serious failings in departmental processes when the government selected the foundation without a competitive tender.   Related: Great Barrier Reef: audit finds $443m grant subject to 'insufficient scrutiny'    Researchers from the government agency have set out on the 25-day trip to remote far northern reefs to survey their health and the effect of severe coral bleaching that occurred during the last mass bleaching event in 2017. The foundation has co-funded the project with a grant to Aims of $574,000. Aims has contributed $833,000 from its own budget toward the trip. Eighteen scientists and crew are on board the research vessel RV Solander and are surveying more than 20 reefs off Cape York, from Cooktown to north of Cape Grenville, to check for signs of coral recovery since bleaching as a result of high ocean temperatures caused mass coral mortality in 2016 and 2017. \u201cReefs in the northern region of the Great Barrier Reef have not been surveyed since late 2016 after a severe coral bleaching event affected the region meaning that the section is long overdue for a health check,\u201d the foundation\u2019s managing director, Anna Marsden, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t currently know the extent of coral loss attributable to the latest bleaching in 2017 or of any other disturbances that have occurred in that time.\u201d In 2017, not-for-profit group Great Barrier Reef Legacy conducted a 21-day study of 12 reefs between Cape York and Cooktown with 20 scientists and crew after use of a boat and about $200,000 were donated. Aims said the expeditions were not comparable because the data the government agency collected was part of long term monitoring work it had conducted for the past 35 years.

It doesn\u2019t hold the corporate memory that is held within official government agencies.\u201d Up to 23 reefs will be surveyed by manta tow where coral cover and crown-of-thorns starfish numbers are calculated around the reef perimeter. Eight reefs will have full surveys conducted by manta tow, divers and using baited remote underwater video stations. Marsden said findings from this survey would be used to guide future monitoring work and the allocation of further funding through the reef grant for climate adaptation work and crown-of-thorns starfish control. They will also serve as a baseline to understand the health of the reefs before any future bleaching occurs. Britta Schaffelke, the program director for the Great Barrier Reef research program at Aims, said little was currently understood about the area being surveyed and the scientists would collect data on both the health of the reefs and the fish communities there. \u201cWe\u2019re interested in the longer-term health of the reef and what we\u2019re more interested in is how reefs recover,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know in the future bleaching will occur but do we understand how they recover and why do some reefs not recover as quickly as they should be? \u201cThat\u2019s why getting this data is so important.\u201d Paul Hardisty, the chief executive of Aims, said it was the first time the RV Solander, which has laboratories, flow-through aquariums and high-tech computing and diving facilities, had been used in Queensland waters. \u201cThis expedition is part of Aims\u2019s commitment to survey the current health of the Great Barrier Reef, as it has done every two years for the past 35 years,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile the situation has eased, there is still the potential for warm sea temperatures to cause coral bleaching.\u201d Both Labor and the Greens have questioned why the grant was awarded to the foundation instead of funds going directly to the environment department and government agencies such as Aims and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority that work on the reef. A Senate inquiry has been examining the process behind the reef grant. The Australian National Audit Office\u2019s audit, which was released last week, found the government gave the department just 11 days to find a private organisation to award the funds to and the department chose the foundation as the \u201cobvious\u201d partner after three days.

In a speech circulated ahead of its delivery at the University of Queensland, the shadow foreign minister said it would be impossible for Labor to replace the $11bn cut from Australia\u2019s aid budget since the Coalition came to power in 2013 but has vowed to increase development assistance as a percentage of national income and commit funds to Pacific programs. Wong says the cuts \u201chave not only had a very real impact to the people who benefit from investments in areas like health and education\u201d, they have \u201cdamaged Australia\u2019s reputation as a reliable partner in the region and lessened Australia\u2019s influence precisely at the same time our national interest compels us to engage more deeply\u201d.

At a time when nationalism and populism is again on the rise, parties of government need to come together to demonstrate investment in international development does not come at the expense of domestic prosperity. Rather, it contributes to it. \u201cBut those calls have been ignored in a time of ultra-partisanship, when the legitimate concerns of Australians struggling with low wage growth and cuts to services can be irresponsibly exploited to undermine the importance of Australia\u2019s international development program.\u201d The result, Wong will say, is not just a fiscal challenge but a political one. \u201cPauline Hanson, for example, continues to call for the entire, and much diminished, development assistance budget to be cut,\u201d Wong says. \u201cShe says that Australia is \u2018shamefully wasting billions on overseas handouts to corrupt governments and unaccountable NGOs\u2019. It is a call sadly echoed by at least some members of the Liberal National party. All of us who believe in a strong and generous Australia must push back and articulate why Australia\u2019s international development programs matter; to the lives of those in our region, to our influence in our region, to our own national interest. \u201cAfter six years of the damage done to Australia\u2019s international development program by the current government, it will require all of us to work together to not only address the policy challenges but the political challenges.\u201d Wong will also speak of the importance of \u201cbetter coordination of Australia\u2019s engagement across government, NGOs, academia and the private sector\u201d, saying \u201caid is one part of Australia\u2019s international engagement, which includes diplomacy, trade, labour mobility and private-sector investment\u201d.

The talks are understood to be ongoing. They follow two years of controversy over the western civilisation university course proposed by the Ramsay Centre and the level of control it has sought over the course when dealing with possible host universities. The Guardian has confirmed the talks, which come amid tensions between the two boards over how much money the Ramsay Centre should receive under the restructured arrangements.   Related: Welcome to the Ramsay Centre for the Cheering on of Western Civilisation | First Dog on the Moon    The Ramsay Centre is currently being funded by the Ramsay Foundation, which was administering the lion\u2019s share of the late Ramsay\u2019s $3.5bn estate. In turn, the centre has been negotiating with universities to fund western civilisation degrees. The Paul Ramsay Foundation board includes Ramsay\u2019s close friends \u2013 Michael Siddle, the chair of Ramsay Health Care, and Peter Evans, a friend from Bowral \u2013 as well as the Liberal party figure Kathryn Greiner and several senior business figures with long experience in charities. Prof Glyn Davis became the chief executive of the foundation in late January after stepping down as the long standing vice-chancellor of Melbourne University. The board of the Ramsay Centre is chaired by the former prime minister John Howard and includes the former prime minister Tony Abbott, Prof Ann Brewer, the dean of the University of Newcastle, former trade unionist turned businessman Michael Easson, and Julian Leeser, who was elected as the Liberal member for Berowra in 2016. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, board members of the foundation, including Siddle, who is one of the late Ramsay\u2019s closest friends, have been \u201cappalled\u201d at the culture wars that have embroiled the centre and the proposed courses. The Australian National University declined to partner with the Ramsay Centre over concerns that the centre\u2019s demands for oversight of the academic direction of the course would breach the university\u2019s own guidelines on academic independence from funders. However, the University of Wollongong subsequently accepted funding and will offer courses in 2020. Discussions are continuing with the University of Queensland.  There is also said to be concern about devoting hundreds of millions of dollars to university degrees that will benefit only a handful of students. The courses are based on tutorials where students can study key texts and achievements of western culture. As well as funding for the courses, the Ramsay Centre will also provide scholarships for about 30 students. Ramsay died in 2014 without leaving clear instructions about what he wanted the foundation to fund. According to the Herald report, three months before his death, Ramsay had commissioned a proposal on a western civilisation centre that would fund courses in the subject at Australian universities \u2013 an idea that had had been put to him a few years earlier by Abbott. But when he died of a heart attack, it was reported that he had neither seen nor approved the draft. Its website says the Paul Ramsay Foundation \u201cis committed to identifying the root causes of disadvantage and implementing strategic solutions to empower our communities\u201d.

Unfortunately this week\u2019s federal budget is just more of the same. Nigel Scullion, the soon-to-retire minister for Indigenous affairs, claimed in his budget-night media release that:  \u2026 the 2019-20 Budget invests in new services that will help break the cycle of disadvantage for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians by providing safe and stable communities, delivering better education for young Indigenous Australians and creating sustainable pathways for job seekers.\u201d  This all sounds reasonable enough. But what does it actually mean?   Related: Indigenous groups denounce Australian budget as 'punishing people in poverty'    Firstly, despite Scullion\u2019s claims there is actually little investment in \u201cnew services\u201d for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the budget. A substantial part of the package had already been announced in February, as a part of the prime minister\u2019s response to the \u201cClosing the Gap\u201d report to parliament. That\u2019s not all. The majority of the February initiatives announced in this budget were recommended in December in a statement to parliament by former prime minister Tony Abbott. This was after he was appointed as \u201cspecial envoy\u201d to Indigenous people. Secondly, the budget has some particular things to say about the government\u2019s broad priorities in Indigenous affairs, and education in particular:  The Budget reaffirms the Coalition Government\u2019s commitment to supporting Indigenous students to attend school and get the education that creates the foundation for a better life.\u201d  On face value, who can argue with this? Certainly not our people, who have been saying for years that education is the key to a foundation for a better life. But what does the Morrison government mean by \u201ceducation\u201d? A closer look at the Indigenous education statement in the budget gives us a clearer view.    Through an historical lens, the Morrison government\u2019s priorities are clear    Through an historical lens, the Morrison government\u2019s priorities are clearOne of budget\u2019s centrepieces on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education was the \u201cTeacher boost for remote Australia\u201d initiative, which aims to attract early-career teachers to remote-area schools. The proposal offers Help debt relief for 3,100 teachers who want to work, and stay working, in very remote areas. While the budget provided scant detail, this announcement comes on the back of the de-funding of the successful More Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Teachers Initiative (MATSITI) in 2014. Through an historical lens, the Morrison government\u2019s priorities are clear. In spite of its rhetoric about getting more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people into university and jobs, this government prioritised the defunding of a successful collaborative industry-wide project \u2013 led by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education experts and teachers \u2013 to address the shortage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander teachers in the workforce. Another part of the budget which focuses on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education is the \u201cYouth Education Package\u201d. This provides $200m \u201cto give more Indigenous students the support and mentoring they need through their secondary studies\u201d.  Again, on face value, the goal of getting more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children into senior secondary education and supporting them to graduate cannot be disputed. However, any approach to rural and remote education which advocates giving an additional $200m in government funding to the AIEF (or similar organisations) shows that the Morrison government has no sustained, long-term plan for improving access to the provision of secondary schooling for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids in their home communities, particularly those living in remote areas. Furthermore, it illustrates that the government is yet to establish a comprehensive national policy response to its own Independent Review into Regional, Rural and Remote Education, commissioned in 2017. Indeed, a search of the government\u2019s own response to the review reveals no mention of the words \u201cIndigenous\u201d or \u201cAboriginal\u201d anywhere in the document. The \u201cGetting Kids to School\u201d program is a $5m boost to the Remote Schools Attendance Strategy (RSAS). This is all well and good, except the evidence about the impact of the program on school attendance is insufficient. Could this be because the RSAS interim progress report in 2015 showed that the program seems to have had a positive impact in only two of the five states and territories where it was implemented? It is also of concern that the report is the only publicly available report which assesses the impact of the strategy. Despite this, the government has boosted its funding. As well as the initiatives spelled out in the budget, it is important to also note the gaps. There is no comprehensive plan for the roll-out of pre-school to all three and four-year-olds across the country, although research shows its benefits for children, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Further, 85% of our kids attend public schools, and yet the government maintains its antipathy towards properly funding public education.  Finally, we must consider the youth-suicide crisis in our communities. Suicide is the leading cause of death among our young people. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander experts have been calling for a comprehensive program of research to determine causal factors and inform a comprehensive, culturally-specific response to this national tragedy. The government offered a paltry $1.25m a year over a four year period (or $5 million over four years) on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth-led suicide prevention initiatives. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be rightfully angry and concerned about this commitment when the federal government has promised to spend $50m to upgrade facilities at the site of Captain Cook\u2019s landing (which incidentally is located in the PM\u2019s seat of Cook) but can only find $5m for suicide prevention. Governments fund their priorities, and the Morrison government is using this year\u2019s budget to tell us that memorialising a white man who died 220 years ago is more important than educating and saving the lives of our young people.   Related: The complete 2019 Australian budget: choose what matters to you \u2013 interactive    The political rhetoric has got to stop. We need change. The continued failure to address poverty, the poor quality of health, and substandard education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people across Australia has become an industry in itself, benefiting services and businesses operated by non-Indigenous people.

But the communications bureaucrat Richard Bean and the former chief executive of News Corp and Foxtel Peter Tonagh concluded the ABC needed expensive new infrastructure to keep up with rapid changes in technology, and long-term funding certainty was preferable to the current triennial funding.

Among the senior hands walking away are award-winning state political editor Gary Adshead and health editor Cathy O\u2019Lear. The new editor, Anthony De Ceglie, called for voluntary redundancies across the West Australian and the Sunday Times because he is bringing the two papers together in a seven-day operation. He has indicated more change is to come, including putting up a paywall. The West Australian director of the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, Tiffany Venning, said in a one-newspaper town such as Perth, the losses would harm the public\u2019s right to know. \u201cThe departure of these journalists means local WA media is shrinking \u2013 and that translates to dramatically less coverage of crucial community issues,\u201d she said.

This happens in our morning \u201chuddle cuddle\u201d, where at 9.15am on the dot our manager has us gather around in a loose circle and run through the day ahead \u2013 how many pieces of work there are to be processed, which queues will be prioritised, who is going to take lunch when. Most other days the huddle cuddle devolves into debate about The Bachelor and analyses of our manager\u2019s internet dating DMs. This is the kind of place where our team of nine refers to each other as family. The kind of place with an A4 printout stuck to the kitchenette fridge that says \u201cif Britney Spears can get through 2007, you can get through today\u201d. The job is a data-processing role at a small member-owned health insurance fund. The \u201cdata\u201d consists mostly of cancellation and policy change requests that come in via email, and the \u201cprocessing\u201d consists mostly of moving these email requests around between different queues in an enterprise management system. I do not personally consider any of it to be important stuff.   Related: Robots will destroy our jobs \u2013 and we're not ready for it    At the interview I was asked not whether, but how much I enjoy repetitive, monotonous tasks. So the fact that I am to be replaced by a robot after 14 months is not in itself unexpected. More surprising and deleterious to my self-esteem is that the robotic engineer leading the project is someone I know from high school. Nathan is sitting at my desk when I return that Monday morning from annual leave. Seeing him there, my first thought is that I have been fired. That in my two-week absence, IT have pulled my browser history and discovered just how little work I do most days. But as becomes clear during the morning\u2019s somewhat tense huddle cuddle, Nathan is not replacing me \u2013 he is here only to oversee the development of my eventual replacement. Rather than be fired, I am to spend the remainder of my temporary contract teaching him how to perform my role so that he can teach his robot. I use the term \u201crobot\u201d both for dramatic effect and because that is how management refer to the project. More accurately, it is Robotic Process Automation, or RPA. Over lunch at the pub on that first day, Nathan explains RPA to me as software customised to mimic human behaviour in order to complete set tasks. Typically repetitive, monotonous tasks, like the ones from which I had claimed in my interview to derive such satisfaction and joy. As Nathan talks, I shovel hot chips into my mouth and try to understand how it is that our paths diverged so dramatically. How it can be that six years out of high school, he is a robotic engineer while I work a job so boring and pointless it feels at times like a physical affliction?    The simple answer, of course, is that in those six years I flunked out of law school and got an arts degree while he gained an in-demand qualification. A 2019 report commissioned by the Australian Computer Society found that Australia\u2019s technology workforce grew 2.5% a year between 2011 and 2018, compared to overall labour market growth of 1.7% a year over the same period. We are on the cusp of exponential technological advancement, sometimes referred to as \u201cthe second half of the chessboard\u201d. The chessboard analogy is derived from folklore (and popularised by futurist Ray Kurzweil) and illustrates the power of (and problem with) exponential trends. In the story, a ruler, so impressed by the game of chess, invites its inventor to name his own reward. The inventor asks for a single grain of rice to be placed on the chessboard\u2019s first square, and for it to be doubled on each subsequent square. By the 64th square, the amount of rice needed to fulfil this request would \u2013 so goes the story \u2013 form a pile far bigger than Mt Everest. The point of the analogy is to show that technological advancement, past a certain point, can have unintended consequences.    The bot ... doesn\u2019t call in sick when hungover or when the existential dread becomes too much       If this is the second half of the chessboard, then Nathan has astutely fashioned himself as an agile bishop, of unfailing utility to the powers that be, and protected against the fate of pawns like me. Research published by the Committee of Economic Development of Australia (Ceda) in 2015 found that as much as 40% of the Australian workforce \u2013 some 5 million disposable chess pieces \u2013 could be replaced by automation by the year 2035. It is a frightening statistic, particularly when considered in conjunction with the well-known fact that lower-paid, lower-skilled jobs are the ones most at risk of automation. The software \u201cbot\u201d is faster and more accurate than a human employee. It works tirelessly without stopping for morning tea or for toilet breaks or to linger by the photocopier. The bot doesn\u2019t have a family to go home to each day at 5pm or to take on school holiday camping trips. It doesn\u2019t call in sick when hungover or when the existential dread becomes too much. It doesn\u2019t have to bother with performative Monday morning staff meetings, or daily huddle cuddles, or with Myers Briggs personality types. It doesn\u2019t continually refresh Seek on its phone in the bathroom. * Unsurprisingly, word of the bot puts people at the health fund on edge. Like a sycophantic new-starter who continues after the first week to wear a tie and stay back late, everyone knows it will be impossible to compete with. The clinical coders, the claims processors, staff from the audit team, and even from the contact centre, whisper in the lunchroom and by the downstairs vending machines, wondering if they\u2019re next. In an attempt to boost morale, People and Culture announce an organisation-wide robot naming competition. The only condition is that the name must \u2013 to really scream technology \u2013 incorporate an Apple-style lowercase \u2018i\u2019. From an internet list of fictional robot names, I submit \u201ciRona\u201d \u2013 the name of the robotic maid in the original Richie Rich comics, stylised to meet the competition guidelines \u2013 because of its close proximity to the word ironic. Almost every other entrant submits \u201cMr Roboto\u201d, and so I win by default.   Related: The robots are definitely coming and will make the world a more unequal place | John Naughton    It\u2019s a pretty transparent attempt to humanise the bot and distract from its core objective, and one that\u2019s in keeping with the positive spin put on continually by employer bodies and the government around automation. Every sinister statistic is quickly followed by the same vague assurance \u2013 although it will displace vast numbers of workers, technology will also create space for entrepreneurs to thrive in. But by the very nature of the concept, we cannot all be entrepreneurs. For me, this job has functioned effectively as a stopgap. The rest of my team are permanent and have been with the organisation longer than I have. The fact of my replacement is a simple case of first on, last off. But I am \u2013 for the time being \u2013 securely employed. I am paid $1.40 more per hour than the law requires to sit in an air-conditioned office. I know I should feel grateful. I know too that I have options, that I can do something else when the time comes. That in this respect I have it better than many.    One of my colleagues moved here from New Zealand as a teenager and cannot become an Australian citizen \u2013 and therefore cannot feasibly go to university \u2013 until he has met a certain income threshold for four consecutive years. Another colleague works part-time, having finally struck something of a balance between earning a salary and spending it all on childcare for her three-year-old daughter. Another is a few years off minimum retirement age and has myriad health concerns. For these colleagues, when their jobs too are eventually supplanted by iRona, entrepreneurship does not seem an entirely helpful solution. By this stage, I have enrolled externally in a postgraduate teaching degree. Teaching seems to me untouchable, a profession immune \u2013 surely \u2013 to the trend of automation. What I do not yet know is that researchers are already experimenting with \u201cbot-teachers\u201d, with the engagement of learners through algorithms. As part of my education degree, I complete a mandatory subject called \u201cTeachers as Leaders and Entrepreneurial Thinkers\u201d. The assessment task involves writing a proposal for an \u201cend-user validated innovation\u201d accompanied by a reflection of personal growth. I approach the subject with dread, visualising the classroom as a Shark Tank-style arena in which I have to critique children\u2019s inventions, reject their ideas for flying scooters and fairy floss sushi, and grade them on their ability to turn profits and keep small businesses afloat.    Not wanting to seem bitter, I join in, grimly cheering my own obsolescence.       A 2016 CSIRO report entitled \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Digitally Enabled Workforce\u201d posits a hypothetical day in the life of \u201cJack\u201d, a secondary school teacher in the year 2035, the same year by which Ceda expects 40% of Australian jobs to have been automated. Jack\u2019s job has become one of facilitator, with instruction occurring via the interactive digital lectures that are delivered to his students as part of the standardised curriculum. Any hint that he may be less than satisfied in a job so diminished by technology is tempered by the otherwise irrelevant detail that Jack has recently chosen to reprioritise family over work. No profession, it seems, will be wholly immune to iRona and her robotic comrades. Bleak though the prospect is of me in the year 2035 as Teacher/Entrepreneur/ Facilitator at the helm of a classroom full of child tycoons, I persevere with the semester, doing most of the set readings and assignments while at work, when I\u2019m not writing job applications. * Over the next few months, Nathan takes the processes I show him and creates a series of codified rules and commands for iRona to follow to complete them. Click open, drag and drop across the screen, press that icon again, and now that one. Repeat. It takes iRona much longer than expected to learn the processes. Nathan talks frustratedly about glitches and bugs. Eventually he has to call in his supervisor who decides to appoint a second engineer to the project. Nathan seems stressed. We stop going to the pub for lunch. The first time iRona successfully completes a process from start to finish, we are all summoned to gather around the screen and watch. Having been put at ease by her cute name and empty reassurances from management, my colleagues clap and cheer and congratulate Nathan. Not wanting to seem bitter, I join in, grimly cheering my own obsolescence. After the health fund, as I chip away at the teaching degree, I work for a while at a union.\u200b One that covers professionals in the public sector, and in the community services and information technology industries. My new office sits opposite a string of other trade union offices, and around the corner from the automation company\u2019s headquarters. I run into Nathan once near work and he tells me that the RPA project has hit a roadblock and been put on hold, with a casual hired to take my place in the interim. But, he says, you know what?

The crunchy vegetable is retailing for as much as $7 a bunch, as a combination of weather-damaged crops and the juice fad squeezes stores. Promoted by lifestyle website Goop, tennis star Novak Djokovic and model Miranda Kerr among others, pure celery juice has been credited with a range of health benefits \u2013 many discredited by scientists.   Related: I spent three days making the smoked watermelon ham \u2013 but at what cost?    But with celery supply low, multiple cafes told Guardian Australia they had seen a surge of celery juice requests from customers, and the peak body for vegetable growers, AusVeg, said there was anecdotal evidence juice was driving celery demand up. Wholesale celery prices reached $2.60 a kilo in February and March, compared with the three-year average of $1. In Sydney and Adelaide, it hit $3.08, according to industry analyst Hort Innovation.   celery sacrifice   AusVeg spokesman Shaun Lindhe said the price spike was due to back-to-back heatwaves hitting Victoria\u2019s growing region at the same time flooding swamped Queensland. \u201cFor celery there has also been an issue with high humidity,\u201d he said. \u201cThat impacts the plant production which has led to a lower yield.\u201d Caroline Attwooll, co-owner of health food store and cafe Umu in Bondi, said there had been a surge in demand for celery juice. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here for 26 years, I\u2019ve probably seen every trend come through and come and go,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve probably doubled our celery sales. There is a demand for it. There is apparently a new diet out: you have a certain amount of celery juice every morning. People who get on to this, they keep coming back. They probably buy two or three days of celery each go. \u201cI only stock organic celery and it\u2019s very expensive at the moment. All the guys at the market say what hasn\u2019t been underwater has been on fire.\u201d Brendan Kleem, owner of online grocer Sydney Fresh, agreed. He said some stores would be selling celery at cost price just to keep up. \u201cThe price has spiked 300%,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wholesale price has been $5 or $6 a bunch. So a store selling it for $7 is only making one or two dollars. A lot of shops will sell it at cost price just to have it on the shelves.\u201d Lindhe said the low level of supply made analysing data difficult, so the industry could not yet confirm if the juice fad was driving up prices. \u201cAnecdotally we do know that more people are interested in juicing celery,\u201d he said. \u201cCelery itself is a very healthy vegetable with a number of health benefits \u2026 We can assume that there is an increased level of demand due to it but don\u2019t have the data to quantify that. \u201cIn the next few months \u2026 we should have more of an understanding of the impact on demand of juicing.\u201d   Related: Give me the green juice: confessions of a juicing fanatic    A 2018 report from Horticulture Innovation Australia found that 10,000 tonnes of celery was juiced every year, 11% of the total vegetables juiced. The benefits of celery juice are purported to include clearer skin, weight loss, liver detoxifying and better gut health. But dietitians have said any health improvements are due to the fact celery is 95% water, and thus is very hydrating \u2013 with some added vitamin C, vitamin K and potassium. Dietitian Lindsay Krasna told Vice that juicing removes fibre from celery, so dieters would be better off drinking normal water and eating the celery, rather than juicing. \u201cThere is no evidence that drinking celery juice, or any juice, has any detoxing or cleansing benefits,\u201d she said.", "Labor targets PM over sports rorts emails and robodebt \u2013 as it happened [2020-02-26T06:38:36Z]": "  6.38am GMT       We are going to close the blog off for the night, but we will be back tomorrow for the last sitting day this week.

Well, actually, I\u2019ve been inundated with support from farmers about their rejection and disagreement with the NFS\u2019s position.  I think I\u2019m solely on the side of future farming in this country, the development of our nation.  The CSIRO report that the Labor party relies on in this debate to say net zero emissions is achievable, that report says agricultural production would experience substantial decline under a net zero emissions model.  That\u2019s just to offset all the carbon emissions that will occur in cities and people flying around, you have to plant lots of trees. That will cost thousands of jobs in regional Australia.  The Labor party have long since deserted support for workers. It\u2019s not just for mining workers, or the manufacturing sector, it\u2019s also all in the food industries as well. Not just on farm, the jobs in sugar mills, the cotton gins, the meat processing facilities. Those are good paying regular jobs that I want to defend.

And Malcolm has a different view than he had when he was in government. I noticed some of his commentary over the summer referring to the bushfire crisis when there were bushfires when he was PM and he pointed out that no single weather event could be attributed directly to climate change.  He\u2019s changed his views since he left government. Good luck to him.

Seselja says there is no way the government could have known what was coming. Including, the bushfires.  We\u2019ve underestimated where our budget position would be over the last few years. And we have tended to overdeliver.  No one could have foreseen the bushfire disaster we\u2019ve had on the back of drought, with coronavirus. As I say, we don\u2019t know where the final position will be but we are in a radically better position with a balanced budget already achieved in order to respond to all of these issues. We\u2019ve taken our fiscal responsibilities very seriously, whilst also seeking to grow the economy.  So the Australian people can have great confidence that when we take spending decisions, we are very, very careful so that we can ensure that we can respond to these crises as they arise.  Except the government was warned about a terrible bushfire season being due. It thought it was going to happen the season before. MPs have said that themselves.

Morrison said the meeting with Rivlin demonstrated the \u201cgreat friendship\u201d between Israel and Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s a friendship between peoples; a friendship that has been born out of deep respect and empathy for the struggles that Israel has faced,\u201d Morrison said.

Richard Marles just accused the prime minister of being \u201cmore nervous than a baboon in Camperdown\u201d. Who says Australia has no culture.     Updated at 4.27am GMT     4.14am GMT       While it is interesting that there were 136 emails exchanged between Bridget McKenzie and Scott Morrison\u2019s office, it\u2019s important to keep it in perspective. On the one hand \u2013 the Australian National Audit Office found the prime minister\u2019s office made both direct and indirect representations about which projects should be funded. On the other, the auditor general, Grant Hehir, said that not all representations changed the outcome of funding decisions and the ANAO did not find sufficient correlation between representations and an outcome to make it a focus of the audit. On 13 February Hehir told a hearing: \u201cThe evidence before us was that the minister was the decision-maker ... If we had have identified someone else as the decision-maker, we would have gone down that path.\u201d Hehir concluded that the community sport infrastructure grant program was \u201cnot informed by appropriate assessment process and sound advice\u201d.    Updated at 4.15am GMT     4.12am GMT       Christian Porter has moved that Anthony Albanese no longer be heard, which will pass, and then Labor will have another go, which will also be shut down, before we get to the final vote, where question time will resume for one or two more dixers.        4.11am GMT       The motion (which will fail) I seek leave to move the following motion \u2014 That the House: 1) notes: a) the prime minister claims his only involvement in the corrupt sports rorts scheme was the passing of information by his office; b) the Audit Office found there were 136 emails between the prime minister\u2019s office and Senator McKenzie\u2019s office over a six-month period about the corrupt sports rorts scheme; c) the Audit Office also found the prime minister\u2019s office emailed Senator McKenzie\u2019s office about projects under the corrupt sports rorts scheme indicating \u201cthese are the ones we think should be included in the list of approved projects\u201d; d) the Audit Office found the colour-coded spreadsheet was shared between Senator McKenzie\u2019s office and the prime minister\u2019s office; and e) in preparing his report, the prime minister\u2019s former chief of staff and now secretary of his department relied on only one version of the colour-coded spreadsheet when there were dozens of versions; and 2) therefore, calls on the prime minister to: a) correct his repeated misleading statements to the parliament that only eligible projects were funded under the corrupt sports rorts scheme when paragraphs 4.32 and 4.33 of the audit of the scheme show 280 ineligible projects were funded; b) explain how his story can withstand the findings of the Audit Office; and c) explain why he has used taxpayer money as though it was his own personal marketing fund.

Updated at 4.06am GMT     4.01am GMT       This is the document the opposition is referring to.    At a #sportsrorts hearing the ANAO said there were &quot;dozens&quot; of emails between the PM&#39;s and McKenzie&#39;s office.Answer on notice: there were 136.That&#39;s what they&#39;re arguing about in Question Time. #auspol pic.twitter.com/IwPy7kObSB&mdash; Paul Karp (@Paul_Karp) February 26, 2020      Updated at 4.02am GMT     4.01am GMT       Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison:  Why did his office received copies of the multiple versions of the colour-coded spreadsheet of the corrupt sports rorts affair program? Why did Mr Gaetjens rely on just one version of the spreadsheet when the auditor general said there were dozens. Did he ignore the other versions of the spreadsheet or was he not ever given them?  Christian Porter tries to stop the question. But he probably should spend less time practicing his dixer replies (which are remarkably similar) and more time studying the standing orders, because you are allowed to ask the prime minister about inquiries he has instigated, involving the head of his own department. Morrison:  As would be appropriate because it was a serious inquiry and I note that the head of prime minister and cabinet, Mr Speaker, he was able to have whatever document he sought to conduct the inquiry and the prime minister\u2019s office complied with all requests of the Secretary, Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, what I can go back to highlight again, what the auditor general said about the matters of the leader of the opposition, settle down, settle down!  What he said was for us to see that there was some driver in this that we would have to identify those representations that there was a bias and there was a correlation in what was in those representations and the outcome, he said that they did not see that.  The auditor general has been quizzed on these very matters and he has found no correlation, Mr Speaker, with the representations that were made from my office with these outcomes. Mr Speaker, the leader of the opposition is trying to throw mud while he himself sits in an absolute swamp, Mr Speaker!  We know that the leader of the opposition had a spreadsheet in his office when he ran a similar program which had a column on it that said Labor or Liberal, Mr Speaker. That is what he had and then he threw the rulebook away and gave the money to the project he wanted to.  Morrison is made to withdraw his final remark, which I missed, but I think involved the word \u201chypocrite\u201d.    Updated at 4.05am GMT     3.56am GMT       Scott Morrison, who told journalists to settle down in a press conference lately, is now telling the opposition to settle down.       3.56am GMT       Paul Fletcher says some things. On what? Who knows. There are words.     Updated at 3.59am GMT     3.55am GMT         Sports Rorts latest: Audit Office says 136 emails between PM&#39;s &amp; McKenzie&#39;s office. Email from PMO indicated &quot;these are the ones we think should be included...&quot; But Audit Office also found those referred by PMO were no more successful than those directly sent by local MP&mdash; David Speers (@David_Speers) February 26, 2020    Scott Morrison:   I want to refer to the evidence provided by the ANAO to the committee ... he [the auditor general] says it was not the case that we could see that those which came directly from the prime minister\u2019s office were more successful than those that came from the local member\u2019s office.  I hope that the leader of the opposition would be more truthful about these things.  I would certainly hope that when he had to appear as a witness at the Labor committal conspiracy trial, Mr Speaker, that he was more truthful there.     Updated at 4.01am GMT     3.48am GMT       Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison:  My question is addressed to the prime minister and it follows his extraordinary answer to my last question. The prime minister has said about the corrupt sports rorts affair program and said that: \u201cAll we did was provide information.\u201d Why did the office tell the [minister] and I quote: \u201cThese are the ones we think should be included in the list of approved projects.\u201d  Morrison:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I repeat what I just said. I said that our office ... Mr Speaker, what I just said to the House in response to the last question, is that we passed on information about other funding options or programs relevant to project proposals and provided proposals based on representations made to us.  Why does the leader of the opposition have an issue with the government talking to people in communities about what their priorities for community projects should be? Mr Speaker, what I know, and I make reference to my earlier answer, Mr Speaker, I and the auditor general reported that the leader of the Labor Party in response to the program ...

After all, as Dutton himself says: \u201cYou can use leftwing to describe everybody from the left to the right. \u201cI said today, I don\u2019t care where people are on the spectrum, if they pose a threat to our country and want to do harm to Australians, then they are in our sights.\u201d    Updated at 3.49am GMT     3.43am GMT       One of the points of relevance is Scott Morrison\u2019s use of the \u2018member for Lindsay\u2019, given that the member for Lindsay at the time was Emma Husar. Morrison:  I\u2019m happy to take the leader of the opposition\u2019s interjection, what I know about the member for Lindsay even if she isn\u2019t in this place she knew what was right, and guess what, Mr Speaker? The people of Lindsay agree with me. Because they elected the member for Lindsay because the member for Lindsay knows what\u2019s best for her community.  Morrison again brings up the auditor general report critical of Anthony Albanese released about 10 years ago. Tony Smith pulls him up on relevance, so Morrison ends with this:  I have set out the role my office played, all I know is that when the leader of the opposition was a minister, he threw the book away and knowingly funded ineligible projects. You want to talk about corruption!  Totally normal discourse.    Updated at 3.49am GMT     3.38am GMT       Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison  The prime minister has claimed his office\u2019s only involvement in the corrupt sports rorts scheme was to pass along information, why has the audit office told the Senate today there were 136 emails about sports rorts going back and forth between the prime minister\u2019s office and Senator McKenzie\u2019s office in under six months.  Morrison:  Neither I nor my office were decision-makers in the process that governs the sports grants program, the decision-maker as has been identified through the audit office was the sports master.  As I stated at the [time], what prime ministers have always done is support their judgement and colleagues because I know they know what is best for their communities.  I know the member for Petrie and the member for Boothby know best for their communities, the member for Lindsay knows what\u2019s best for her community. I know what is best for our communities right across the country.  There is a back and forth over whether the prime minister is being relevant.     Updated at 3.47am GMT     3.35am GMT       Christian Porter is delivering the next dixer, but he appears to have practiced this once too many times in front of the mirror, because it seems a bit stale. The human vision board is entertaining the prime minister though, so he can count that as a brownie point.        3.34am GMT       Tanya Plibersek to Scott Morrison: Why have nearly 140,000 apprentice and trainee places been lost under the seven-year-old government?  Morrison:  Thank you for your question about apprentices and the trends we are seeing in apprenticeship numbers and I am pleased to inform the House that in the 2019-20 budget the government provided $585m for skills measures to implement long needed reforms in the veteran sector and created up to 80,000 new apprenticeship places through the new incentive scheme, kicked off on July 1, 2019, which is after the period of the trends that the member is referring to.  So the funding the government has put in place to do with these issues commenced and went in place from 1 July, 2019.  Apprentices and their employees have readily taken up the new scheme with almost 6,000 additional apprentices signed up just the six months.  I note that at the same time we have increased the funding when it comes to the vet sector, states and territories responsible for the delivery of that, including Tafe funding have withdrawn funding from $4bn in 2013 and down to $3.1m in 2017 The Commonwealth is stepping up a meeting up commitment to ensure we get more apprentices in place and to address the issues that the member has raised but I do note to compare and contrast, that when the Labor party was last in power, between 2011 \u2013 2013, Labor cut employer incentives to businesses that employ apprentices nine times, totalling $1.2bn and when the leader of the opposition was deputy prime minister, Labor cut $241m from incentives to encourage employers to take on apprentices and in 2012-13, the number of apprentices and trainees in training collapsed under Labor by 22%, or $110,000.  I am not going to cop lectures from a Labor party that does not know how to manage money and run an economy and does not have a plan.

We are investing in new and storage projects like Snowy 2.0 to make sure we have a secure, reliable grid.  Yup. And you know what we need to make snowy viable? Katharine Murphy does:    Fun fact. Just because the Coalition keeps flagging the Marinus Link as part of its plan: the viability of that project depends (according to the people developing it) on coal leaving the system, and relatively quickly.

New Zealand has announced it will deliver one. It basically lists what the government is doing to tackle well-being issues impacting its population \u2013 things like mental health, suicide prevention, child welfare, indigenous welfare, homelessness and equality. Frydenberg thinks this is hilarious:  Picture this alternative, the Member for Rankin is about to deliver his first wellbeing budget. He walks in, therefore, into the Chamber and robes are flowing. Incense is burning, Mr Speaker. These are in one hand and gone are the seats, gone are the benches, Mr Speaker and in their place, meditation mats for all, Mr Speaker. Meditation mats for all and the Member for Rankin stands up to address the Chamber to announce that his wellbeing tour has gone national, hugs for all, Mr Speaker!  Hugs for all! There is a warning to every Australian, Mr Speaker, when the Member for Rankin provides him with a hug and a kiss he will take away their wallets.  This is the same government that scrapped the women\u2019s statement in the budget (the one which worked out how the budget would impact women) under Tony Abbott (before Kelly O\u2019Dwyer insisted it be reinstated) so sure. Let\u2019s attack wellbeing. How about we kick some puppies into the sun a bit later? Maybe burn some kid\u2019s art?     Updated at 3.31am GMT     3.20am GMT       Adam Bandt delivers a question which covers War and Peace and everything in between, which just gives the prime minister carte blanche to talk about whatever he wants. Bandt:  Now the coronavirus is hurting us as well. This is on top of the underemployment crisis in the country plus wage stagnation and an inequality crisis. With the risk of the economy heading towards recession and the Reserve Bank running out of bullets, will you back a Green New Deal to fight the threat of recession and lift public-sector wages to boost wage growth across the economy, will you start by at least $95 a week to encourage retail spending and invest $6bn to remove the grid bottlenecks holding back renewable energy investments and grow construction and manufacturing jobs?\u201d  Scott Morrison:  It would be a great relief that we are not going to adopt the policy of the Greens! It would be a great relief for the people, I cannot speak for the Labor party because they are known to like quite a few of the Greens ideas when it comes to economic policy so I do not think they can provide that same assurance.\u201d  Morrison then wanders into dixer territory about why his government is the greatest government to govern ever in the history of governments.    Updated at 3.40am GMT     3.17am GMT       Julie Collins to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister, why is the prime minister privatising aged care assessments? Greg Hunt gets the nod:  We reject the proposition put forward by the member that is inaccurate, untrue, and it is false. I will make this point, what we are doing \u2026 is making sure we are having a system which actually delivers better, better outcomes for patients who are seeking to enter residential aged care or have some kind of aged care assessment, that\u2019s exactly what we are doing. In terms of the implementation we will work with states, I make this offer ahead of Coag at the end of this week, we are looking forward to working with the states in a constructive fashion, what the opposition are saying is that they will abandon the practice they had when they were in government on using non-government providers to assist with the assessment process, that\u2019s the change, or are they not?  Here is the question for the opposition to take away from this, are they now saying they would abandon all of those current, non-government providers which were in place when they were in government, which they did not propose to change at the election, or is this a case of simply making it up as they go along? Because we know one thing, when they had the opportunity, only a few months ago, the current shadow minister was the current minister going into the election, they had a chance to invest in aged care, what did they provide for residential care, nothing. For home care, nothing, they know that we know that and the Australian public knows that.     Updated at 3.20am GMT     3.15am GMT       Michael McCormack\u2019s performance is so bad, even the Speaker alerts him to the concept of the inside voice.   Can I assure the deputy prime minister his microphone is in good working order, so far.  We were so preoccupied with whether or not we could turn a loaf of bread into a politician, we didn\u2019t stop to think if we should.     Updated at 3.17am GMT     3.13am GMT       Michael McCormack is now pretending to be a leader by acting as if he has just discovered hands and wants you all to know about it.        3.10am GMT       Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison: The government social security law guide, which was released on 10 February this year, states Australian government employees have a duty of care to the public in performing their duties. But government lawyers on February 14 stated the policy in the robodebt class action does not owe Centrelink recipients a duty of care. Does the government owe a duty of care to Centrelink recipients? Morrison:  The duty of care to the Australian people including those who depend on their social services payment which enables them to deal with the difficulties in their lives and at a time like this, when the country is facing some very difficult challenges \u2013 I refer to the impact of the bushfires and coronavirus which means more and more Australians because of the automatic stabilisers of social security payments which go to those impacted by the economic shocks we are now experiencing. What they deserve from a government is to be able to pay their bills and make sure we can make the payments we can make to them, as we have, and we make sure we do that, one of the ways, as a government, we have been able to make sure people can rely on the services of the essential government delivers with a Centrelink payers or other support payments, aged care payments as you need to know how to manage money, that means when you are making payments to those, you pay them  If anyone is managing to pay their bills on Newstart, let me know.

Robert again starts talking about the wonderful social safety net, so Shorten raises a point of order on direct relevance. Smith once again tells Robert to get on with it.

DEIDRE CHAMBERS       2.57am GMT       Universities Australia chair Deborah Terry has just spoken at the National Press Club about the need for science and expertise to guide Australia\u2019s response to the coronavirus and climate change, although she steered clear of political commentary when asked why some politicians refuse to believe the science.Terry had a few pointed lines on the issue of freedom of speech on campus: \u201cLast April, a review by a former high court chief justice [Robert French] found that claims of freedom of speech crisis were \u2018Not substantiated\u2019. But offered a guide for each university to consider how its existing policies breathed life into those freedoms. So, in the 10 months since, each university has carefully and thoughtfully mapped that guide against its own policies.\u201d Earlier today the education minister, Dan Tehan, spoke to the Universities Australia conference, and revealed the government would include freedom of speech in the school experience survey. Asked if the university sector would seek some form of federal funding to compensate for the impact of coronavirus, Terry responds that the first priority is the wellbeing of students, but does not rule out seeking assistance in future. She said: \u201cYes, in the background, we are looking at what the implications of it might be, [we\u2019re] doing some modelling in the background. But that is not what is taking up our time at the moment. It is too early to tell. It is too early to tell what effects some mitigating arrangements might have. It\u2019s too early to tell what, for instance, might be something that will come out of the fact that actually, our semester two starts earlier than the northern hemisphere teaching periods. So it\u2019s too early. What I want to say is here - our focus is on the students and what they need at the moment. They are our students. They are part of our community and we must keep our focus there.\u201d    Updated at 3.06am GMT     2.56am GMT       New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern will be in town later this week. She has already said she won\u2019t be \u201cwaggling\u201d her finger at Australia over our climate policies. I would expect Australia\u2019s immigration policies will come up, though. It is still a pretty big bone of contention that Australia is deporting people who may have been born in New Zealand but lived here their whole life, if they are imprisoned.

To repeat, the Australian government, on medical advice, has lifted our travel advisory for northern Italy, in particular. That is exercise a high degree of caution \u2013 level two, of our travel advisory \u2013 for the provinces of Lombardy and Veneto.  In addition, with regards to Iran, we have higher levels of travel advisory for non-medical reasons, but we have issued additional advice with regards to exercising a high degree of caution in relation to any travel to Iran, where we have had an increase in the numbers and significantly high number of deaths, which as the chief medical officer indicated yesterday, may be a strong guide that the number of cases is greater than those that have been reported.

A senior member of the International Olympic Committee says if it\u2019s too dangerous to hold the Tokyo Olympics because of the coronavirus, the event could be cancelled rather than postponed. Canadian official Dick Pound, who has been on the IOC since 1978, estimated there is a three-month window \u2013 or even two months \u2013 to decide the fate of the Tokyo Olympics, meaning a decision could be put off until late May. \u201cIn and around that time, I\u2019d say folks are going to have to ask: \u2018Is this under sufficient control that we can be confident about going to Tokyo or not?\u201d\u2019 he told the Associated Press. As the games draw near, he said: \u201cA lot of things have to start happening. You\u2019ve got to start ramping up your security, your food, the Olympic village, the hotels. The media folks will be in there building their studios.\u201d If the IOC decides the games cannot go forward as scheduled in Tokyo, \u201cyou\u2019re probably looking at a cancellation,\u201d he said.

Updated at 1.09am GMT     12.45am GMT       Mark Butler has a few things to say to Keith Pitt this morning:  This morning on ABC Breakfast, resources minister Keith Pitt, in response to a question about the government\u2019s $4m coal feasibility study, said:  \u201cI\u2019m technology agnostic \u2013 if you look at HELE coal, super critical boilers combined with CCS \u2013 that is a 90% reduction on emissions from legacy brown coal power stations around the country.   \u201cSo if we want to take the opportunity to look at this with open minds I think there are opportunities for building further power stations right around the country , and we need them.\u201d Bloomberg New Energy Finance has estimated the cost of a HELE power station with CCS as $352/Mwh. In comparison, Snowy Hydro are selling dispatchable renewables for $70/Mwh. And the government has itself a target of wholesale price at $70/Mwh. Not to mention the fact that any serious research and development into CCS technology was scrapped by this government\u2019s cut of $400m and effective abolition of the carbon capture and storage flagships program.      Updated at 12.52am GMT     12.44am GMT       Reuven Rivlin to Scott Morrison: We appreciate your welcome and we must say, the appreciation comes from the bottom of our hearts because we know that when you are blessing us and hosting us, you are doing it from the bottom of your heart.  And I must say to you, Mr Prime Minister, Australia is a great friend of Israel, a real great friend.  Once upon a time we used to say the firm relationship of Israel is based on three principles: the relationship with the United States, second, not necessarily as important, the relationship with the United States, and the last but not least, the relationship with the United States.  Now, it\u2019s not only that. It\u2019s the relationship between United States and Australia.  Really, the relationship and friendship Australia comes out of the relation between people, between, really, sharing the same values that we are sharing.  You are ambassador in Jerusalem, I know Tel Aviv, but Israel is very small. I think it is very close to Jerusalem. I must say, we really salute Australians for what they have done and what they are doing just now.  For example, the ICC, the ICC is a real \u2013 you are a beacon. You are a beacon to show people all around and understand.  The Israeli army are the soldiers of our sons and daughters. And our grandsons and granddaughters.  The army of Israel is the army to defend our homes and to keep Israel as a really safe haven to everyone, but we would like to live in democracy and harmony.  Israel has been defined as a Jewish state, nevertheless it is a democratic one. It is a Jewish democratic state as much as it is a democratic Jewish state.  And I know you appreciate that and all of your government, and I know how we appreciate that.  And you are standing behind us once the political ideas of people who are taking part in the international organisations \u2013 very much cleared by you and your prime minister \u2013 saying there is no way to end date Israel once we\u2019re talking about the unification of his, not only the duty of Israel, the right of Israel to protect its citizens and people who are living with us.      Updated at 12.55am GMT     12.41am GMT       Scott Morrison to Reuven Rivlin:  Australia and Israel have a great friendship, and it\u2019s a friendship between people, a friendship that has been born out of deep respect and empathy for the struggles that Israel has faced.  At Israel\u2019s Jewish people\u2019s worst times, Australia has been there, and will always be there to support the Jewish people. And the state of Israel as well.  And my recent remarks, our position has been very strong when it comes to defending the great democracy that is the state of Israel. A beacon in an area where democracy is something that is not as widespread, but certainly the freedom of the press and stridency of the judiciary and all of these great principles and values that underpin freedom I what the state of Israel stands for.  So it is a very easy, very comfortable, very relaxed relationship that rests in I think deep affection and also one that rests in a deep sharing of values and beliefs about what\u2019s important.  So it\u2019s a great honour to have you here, particularly someone not only of your very high office, but someone of your esteemed background and contribution.

Morrison and Frydenberg had no plan before the coronavirus, they have no plan now. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve had disappointing growth, stagnant wages, record household debt, more than doubled public debt, and extraordinarily weak productivity and business investment. The government needs to come up with a plan. They need to provide economic leadership which has been lacking for so long now. They shouldn\u2019t be pretending in their seventh year of government that all of this economic weakness is somehow the product of coronavirus which hit in recent weeks. The country is crying out for leadership and a plan and Scott Morrison is unwilling or unable to provide either.  For those wondering why Labor is going so hard on this, given the outside factors, just remember that Chalmers was in Wayne Swan\u2019s office when the GFC hit and how then Coalition opposition responded. There was no leeway there for not being able to deliver a surplus in the midst of the greatest economic challenge since the Great Depression. And there will be none here.     Updated at 12.58am GMT     12.15am GMT       Here is some of what Josh Frydenberg has been saying during his \u201clowering expectations tour\u201d rounds (from AAP): \u201cBut I do know that this is going to hit the economy, and I do know that our focus has been, in relation to the fires and other shocks that we\u2019ve faced, on getting the support to the community in need,\u201d he told Sky News on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s been our primary focus, not the surplus.\u201d He noted the government had already notched up an achievement in delivering the first balanced budget in 11 years, at the same time as it rolled out tax cuts. \u201cWe\u2019re back in balance, and no one can ever take that away from us,\u201d he told ABC Radio National. The treasurer was also coy when asked whether a recession could be on its way. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s not the word I would use,\u201d before noting he\u2019s waiting to see the figures from the December and March quarters. Frydenberg stressed this was just the latest economic shock the Australian economy has faced, following trade tensions between the US and China, an extended drought, bushfires and floods. The virus is also a shock beyond our control, he said.    Updated at 2.42am GMT     12.11am GMT       Non-government senators are still taking up the government business time in the Senate.

That would make him Gen X. But quotes like this:  How would it be unethical for a political party to say write to the over 65s to say this is what we\u2019re doing with the pension and to the person under the age of 21 to say this is what we\u2019re doing with ... I don\u2019t know, under 21 issues, whatever they are.\u201d  He is displaying BIG boomer energy. Proving, once and for all, that boomer is a frame of mind.     Updated at 12.01am GMT     11.56pm GMT       Caroline Fisher told the electoral committee that there was \u201ca lot of concern\u201d around political advertising and campaigning that was \u201cless than honest, and very dubious\u201d including Labor\u2019s Mediscare campaign in 2016 and the anti-Labor \u201ctax scare campaign\u201d in 2019. Fisher said while there was \u201clittle evidence of international interference\u201d in the election \u2013 there were questionable claims made by political parties and \u201cthe outcome of the election seems to indicate it did have an impact\u201d. Labor then pursued a line of questioning about micro-targeting of voters through social media ads, which Fisher suggests may not be \u201cethical\u201d because it allows parties to target people\u2019s particular prejudices without giving everyone the same information. JSCEM chair, James McGrath, speaks in defence of micro-targeting, noting different groups of voters have different interests. He said:  How would it be unethical for a political party to say write to the over 65s to say this is what we\u2019re doing with the pension and to the person under the age of 21 to say this is what we\u2019re doing with ...

He sounded *this close* to saying skate parks.    Updated at 11.58pm GMT     11.32pm GMT       The joint standing committee on electoral matters has a hearing in Canberra examining whether fake news played a role in the 2019 election. Caroline Fisher, from the News and Media Research Centre, said Australians are the \u201clightest\u201d consumers of news in the world:  Almost half of all Australians only get news once a day or less. Two thirds are concerned if news is fake but only one third did any fact checking. 60% are interested in news but only one third in politics \u2013 meaning 65% said they had no to low interest in politics.  Fisher said that \u201cof most concern\u201d is the fact that those who don\u2019t know their political orientation and aren\u2019t interested in politics do not engage in fact-checking. She said: \u201cThese less engaged consumers are more likely to be female, younger and less educated. In an environment of tainted information, they fact-check the least. This group is possibly aligned with undecided voters, and if so they are voting based on the fewest news sources. This represents a significant population of disengaged voters, who are more vulnerable to misinformation.\u201d Michael Jensen, associate professor at the University of Canberra, said he did not see evidence of \u201csizeable or sustained effort by Russia or China to sway the Australian federal election\u201d. For Russia, there was \u201clittle difference\u201d between the Coalition and Labor to their strategic interests. For China, there was \u201cclear evidence the CCP is opposed to this government and believe it is especially hostile to its interests\u201d. He cited an article in propaganda outlet the Global Times that Labor \u201cmight change Australia\u2019s attitude to Washington and be more favourable to Beijing\u201d. But China did not intervene, he said, perhaps because it was a high-risk low-reward proposition, and perhaps because they believed Labor would win anyway. Jensen said both are engage in political interference on particular issues including in favour of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative and Huawei\u2019s involvement in the 5G network; and for Russia, in undermining faith in institutions generally.

Here he was this morning.  Honestly. Four-day-old oats have more appeal:  A surplus is a number that I know that is in important to get the books back in balance and that is what we have done. Labor, well, they wouldn\u2019t know what the definition of a surplus was, they haven\u2019t produced one since 1989 when Cher was singing If I Could Turn Back Time, of course we all remember that vision of her on that navy ship, and there you go again, Labor didn\u2019t even build a navy ship and they had six years, six years of opportunity, didn\u2019t give a ship, didn\u2019t give a ship at all, about making sure that we built the infrastructure to increase defence capability.  If Labor could only turn back time who knows what might happen.\u201d  But we also get a sportsball (that\u2019s what the people like, right? Sportsball) reference, when asked if the surplus is sunk.  I don\u2019t believe so, and you\u2019ll have to wait until May. It\u2019s like suggesting that Hawthorn\u2019s not going to win the premiership and it\u2019s only February. I am hoping that Hawthorn will win the premiership, they\u2019ve lost a trial game the other day, you know, it\u2019s early day.\u201d  So, obviously, Hawthorn is now cancelled.

Here he is this morning, as reported by AAP:  Nationals leader Michael McCormack has cast aspersions on the farming sector\u2019s aims to cut emissions over the next decade. The National Farmers\u2019 Federation has had a policy for almost two years for the sector to be \u201ctrending towards carbon neutrality by 2030\u201d. Its 2030 roadmap also says Australia could become a global leader in low-emissions agriculture, although cautions a poor policy response \u201ccould saddle farm businesses with additional costs\u201d. The move towards carbon neutrality has been seized by Labor to back its commitment to bring Australia down to net zero emissions by 2050. But the deputy prime minister is sceptical about the NFF aims. \u201cTrending towards and actually achieving might be two different things,\u201d McCormack told Sky News on Wednesday. \u201cWhat the Nationals support is jobs in regional Australia and jobs in agriculture.\u201d Asked whether he backed the NFF\u2019s plans, he said only that it was aspirational. \u201cIt\u2019s aspirational by the NFF, good on them, and I support Fiona Simson and what the NFF stand for,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fact remains we want to make sure we grow agriculture.\u201d  Unless of course, we need water for irrigators. Or if a mine needs to go in a food bowl.  It\u2019s so difficult being a Nat these days.

No one is really clear on what that actually means just yet, but it\u2019s something to do with the technology the government is looking at for energy security moving forward.  Anyways, Pitt has discovered the word commitment and he\u2019s not afraid to use it.   We made a commitment internationally. We will meet our commitment. We took that proposal to the election. I\u2019m a member of the government. I support what we are doing. We took a balanced proposition, it was accepted by the Australian people at the election.  They clearly rejected what was put forward by then Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten. Although I see Mr Anthony Albanese has decided he wants to head down the same track, uncosted an unplanned targets. I don\u2019t think people will fall for it. We\u2019re looking at a technology road map as you know. We\u2019re looking for opportunities into the future.  I\u2019m sure those shareholding ministers that have responsibility for that area will be making statements later in the year.  But right now we\u2019re committed to 2030. We\u2019ll deliver on our commitments, we\u2019ll do what we said we would.  We have taken a balanced proposition to the Australian and it has been accepted. Up to $4 million for the feasible study.  It was an election commitment. We deliver on our election commitments. And feasibility studies determine feasibility, that\u2019s what they\u2019re for.

In the midst of that word vomit, you may have missed this from Katharine Murphy:  While the debate about false equivalence played out in public, Guardian Australia has also confirmed that one of the minister\u2019s advisers cited the climate activist group Extinction Rebellion as an example of a troublesome leftwing organisation during a telephone conversation with a member of the public who sought to query Dutton\u2019s controversial intervention in the debate. Matthew Noel, an engineering student from New South Wales, says he rang Dutton\u2019s ministerial office in Canberra on Tuesday morning. Noel says he telephoned to try to establish exactly who the minister was referring to when he raised the spectre of leftwing terrorism. The student says he spoke to an adviser who identified himself as Mark. Noel says the adviser over the course of the call identified the group Extinction Rebellion as an example of leftwing terrorism. Noel says he said to the adviser: \u201cAre you saying Extinction Rebellion are a terrorist group? [The adviser] replied, yes.\u201d Dutton\u2019s office has confirmed the call took place. But a spokeswoman disputes some of Noel\u2019s recollection of the conversation. Dutton\u2019s spokeswoman told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe allegation that a member of staff nominated Extinction Rebellion as an example of a leftwing terror group is completely false. \u201cWhen asked by the caller, the staff member advised that the group is an example of a leftwing extremist group, not a terrorist group.\u201d Asked whether the adviser was reflecting the minister\u2019s view during the conversation, the spokeswoman said: \u201cThe minister does not believe this group is a leftwing terror organisation.\u201d     Updated at 10.16pm GMT     10.01pm GMT       Parliament starts at 9.30am this morning.

After spending the better part of the last eight years smashing up Wayne Swan for promising a series of surpluses and then failing deliver (because of that little thing called the global financial crisis), the Morrison government is attempting to get out ahead of it\u2019s own potential failure by reminding everyone they can find that the world economy is under quite a bit of pressure. If the surplus disappears, which, Frydenberg and Scott Morrison\u2019s language makes clear is a real possibility, given the bushfires, drought and now coronavirus impacts, it\u2019s a little more embarrassing given there was an entire advertising campaign dedicated to moody, slightly smug, black and white portraits of the government\u2019s leaders declaring the budget was BACK IN BLACK.

After a tweet storm on Sunday during Insiders:    The consequences of this transition: a habitable planet, cheaper energy,  more economic growth and jobs. Regions? Most of the renewable investment is in the regions. To get there above all we need a coherent integration of climate and energy policy.&mdash; Malcolm Turnbull (@TurnbullMalcolm) February 22, 2020    Turnbull is now taking every opportunity to remind people of what the cost of inaction is. As Crowe reports:  There is no economic case for building a new coal-fired power station in Australia anymore, regardless what you think about carbon policy \u2013 and everyone in the energy sector knows that. But if you read the News Limited newspapers and listen to debates in Canberra, it\u2019s a parallel universe. As to the future of the coal industry, we should all hope that thermal coal is going to go out of business, not just in Australia but around the world. Because if it doesn\u2019t, and we\u2019re still burning coal to generate energy in 30 or 40 years, we\u2019re moving into a 3C environment, which is catastrophic.\u201d  Meanwhile, Josh Frydenberg is having to explain how he is not embarrassed about the government getting so excited about the possibility of a surplus it launched a \u201cback in black\u201d advertising campaign \u2013 and $35 souvenir mug \u2013 when it is looking increasingly likely the surplus is gone, and avoiding negative growth will be lineball. We\u2019ll bring you that, and everything else as it happens. You have Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp as well as a one coffee me. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.

Johns answered: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\u201d \n   \n  Well, we have an update, courtesy of estimates. \n  Jenny McAllister: Dr Johns, the last time you appeared before this committee we had a conversation about acknowledgment of country. Subsequent to the exchange that we had, I understand that the Minister for Indigenous Affairs wrote to you and reassured you directly, saying \u201cI do not believe that such an inference could be drawn from such references in the signature blocks of ACNC officers.\u201d  \n  So it must have been something of a relief to realise that you can acknowledge country without creating a perception of bias. \n  Did you respond to Mr Scullion \u2013 Senator Scullion I should say? \n  Gary Johns:  \n   \n   Yes, and I made it clear that the decision of bias is mine - the question is whether I consider it an issue on my signature block in my commission. So the Senator\u2019s view does not carry any weight in my decision. \n   Sorry, it might be a useful piece of information, but it\u2019s not determinative of my view. \n   \n  JM: So your evidence to this committee is that the Minister for Indigenous Affairs\u2019 viewabout this matter carries no weight with you? \n  GJ: It\u2019s not determinative; it\u2019s my view that carries the issue of whether I consider the particular form of acknowledgment to carry with it the risk of perceived bias. \n  \n Updated at 7.27am GMT \n \n \n  6.52am GMT  \n  \n  All of the hugs \n  \n Updated at 6.54am GMT \n \n \n  6.42am GMT  \n  \n  The Defence department has confirmed it no longer pays taxpayer dollars to social media influencers. \n  The Herald Sun reported on Wednesday that swimmer Lachlan Carter was one of 14 social media influencers who were paid a total of $54,908 by the department in the past two years.  \n  Carter was spruiking the Navy\u2019s Young Endeavour sailing program with instagram hashtags like: #hotguys and #sixpackvibes. \n  Under questioning from Labor senator Kimberley Kitching, Defence officials told a Senate estimates hearing the department stopped using influencers in August last year. \n  An official said the decision coincided with a discovery that two influencers used as part of a defence force recruiting campaign \u201cwere not aligned with Defence values\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 6.46am GMT \n \n \n  6.13am GMT  \n  \n   \n   \n    Retiring MP Jenny Macklin gets a hug from @SenatorWong after delivering her valedictory speech. @AmyRemeikis @mpbowers pic.twitter.com/JAb8hz0Erd\u2014 Lyndal Curtis (@lyndalcurtis) February 20, 2019\n    \n   \n   \n   \n    Hugs for @KellyODwyer from two of those she singled out in her valedictory - @JulieBishopMP &amp; the Speaker, Tony Smith. @AmyRemeikis @mpbowers pic.twitter.com/73QjZceWpu\u2014 Lyndal Curtis (@lyndalcurtis) February 20, 2019\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  6.05am GMT  \n  \n  Anthony Albanese takes to the despatch box to thank Kelly O\u2019Dwyer for her speech and her contribution to the parliament, on behalf of the Labor party, and says he wants to acknowledge the sacrifice she has made, to her family, in order to be able to serve as a MP and minister. \n  \n Updated at 6.12am GMT \n \n \n  6.04am GMT  \n  \n  Catherine King on the number of opt-outs in MyHealth: \n   \n   Under Labor questioning in Senate estimates on Wednesday, the Australian Digital Health Agency revealed 2,517,921 opted out of the system before the end of January. \n   And that figure doesn\u2019t include an estimated 300,000 others who had records but cancelled them. \n   That\u2019s a dramatic increase on the 1,147,000 figure the Agency revealed in October \u2013 showing 1.4 million Australians scrambled to opt out after the government\u2019s original planned end date. \n   Labor supports a national digital health record \u2013 which is why we created one when we were last in government. \n   But the government\u2019s rushed implementation of an opt-out model created a range of problems and severely undermined public support for a system that could deliver enormous health benefits for all Australians.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.06am GMT \n \n \n  6.02am GMT  \n  \n  She concludes with: \n   \n   I want to thank my colleagues, including a number who I have worked with across the aisle, and in particular Julie Bishop for her friendship and guidance. \n   I am lucky that before I came into this place I had two life-long friends who were already here \u2013 the speaker of the house, Tony Smith, and the president of the Senate, Scott Ryan \u2013 who are like big brothers to me, and like big brothers can both delight and infuriate me. \n   I want to place on record my thanks to Malcolm Turnbull for his friendship and also his great support of me when I gave birth \u2013 the first serving Cabinet Minister to do so.  \n   He also made me the youngest female cabinet minister and, together with Scott Morrison, gave me portfolios with complex policy issues to work through. I have loved the intellectual stimulation and technical detail that has come with the second largest legislative workload in this place. \n   I would like to place on record my gratitude to the many hard-working public servants in my various portfolios and the teams of people who enable our Parliament to function. \n   To the prime minister, thank you for your friendship, determination, courage and leadership. It has never been more needed than now and I know that with you our country is in good hands. \n   I thank the house for its indulgence.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.08am GMT \n \n \n  6.00am GMT  \n  \n  Kelly O\u2019Dwyer uses her final speech to back a call from Scott Ryan: \n   \n   As my final observation in this place, I think that elected governments should be able to implement their mandates. I support the proposition endorsed by the Senate president for major parties to consider implementing an Australian version of the Salisbury Convention. This would mean parties agreeing to abide by a convention that the Senate won\u2019t obstruct the passage of legislation to effect government policy which has been fully and fairly disclosed to the Australian people well before voting commences in an election.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.09am GMT \n \n \n  5.57am GMT  \n  \n  Sarah Hanson-Young looks like she is in the chamber to hear Kelly O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s speech. \n  A lot of Labor and the crossbench have stayed.

Time spent in the community is the best antidote. \n   However technology has accelerated our lives and our expectations. Complex policy issues in an increasingly complex world don\u2019t usually have an easy answer. The default response here should not be to immediately outsource decision making to unelected people.  \n   And sometimes parliamentarians need to prosecute the case for patience and a deeper conversation with their electorates.\u201d \n   \n  \n \n \n  5.36am GMT  \n  \n  Kelly O\u2019Dwyer begins her valedictory speech. \n   \n   I start today with the words that concluded my very first speech in this place: \n   \u2018I will never forget that politics is about people. And that people can make a difference. That is why I am here. I look forward to playing my part in building an even better Australia.\u2019 \n   Going on a decade as the Federal Member for Higgins, I believe that I have been able to do that. \n   As anyone who has had the honour of serving in this place knows, you can\u2019t make a contribution here without a lot of support. \n   I want to start by thanking the people of Higgins for the privilege of representing them in this place and for entrusting me to represent their issues both big and small. I especially want to thank them for giving me the opportunity to share in the important moments in their lives, and those of their families. \n   I also want to thank the extraordinary members of the Liberal party. \n   I joined the party as a 17 year old because I believe people should be free to choose their own paths in life, that they should be rewarded for hard work and enterprise, and that everyone, regardless of background or circumstance, deserves respect and the opportunity to live their best life. \n   Thank you for giving me the opportunity to prosecute those values in this place.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.38am GMT \n \n \n  5.29am GMT  \n  \n  Jenny Macklin finishes with love: \n   \n   My first vote was in 1974 \u2013 for Gough and for Labor. \n   I couldn\u2019t vote in the 1972 \u201cIt\u2019s Time\u201d election, because 18 year olds weren\u2019t allowed to vote back then \u2013 though Gough would change that. \n   But I do remember being swept up in the energy and urgency of that election \u2013 the infectious feeling that change was finally coming. \n   Gough said, \u201cIt\u2019s time\u201d \u2013 and it was. \n   And now \u201cIt\u2019s time\u201d for me. \n   Time to move on. Time to step back. Time for this new generation of brilliant people to make their impact \u2013 as I know you will. \n   There is nothing wrong with having a big heart in politics. Seriously there is nothing wrong at all with having a big heart. \n   There are people who really need us, who really need on us. \n   Heed the words of Martin Luther King: \n   \u201cPower without love is reckless and abusive, and love without power is sentimental and anaemic.  \n   \u201cPower at its best is love implementing the demands of justice, and justice at its best is power correcting everything that stands against love.\u201d \n   \n  \n \n \n  5.26am GMT  \n  \n  Jenny Macklin also thanks the Coalition: \n   \n   I should say something about those opposite. \n   It doesn\u2019t happen often, but when we find a common cause, it\u2019s important and impactful. What an amazing day it was when we all voted together for the National Disability Insurance Scheme.\u201d \n   \n  As with Wayne Swan\u2019s speech yesterday, there is barely anyone on the government benches to hear this speech.

I am originally a Queenslander so it must be that! \n   But both so special to me. I thank them for their friendship. \n   Also Anthony Albanese, who has always had my back. And Linda Burney, who has the biggest heart. \n   Tony Burke, as the leader of opposition business, who has kept me on the tactics committee longer than anyone should. \n   As well as our leaders, it\u2019s our whips who keep us all together. \n   Chris Hayes is a true gentleman of politics, whose only failing of leadership has been his decision to appoint me as captain of our parliamentary swimming team. \n   In all this time we\u2019ve only beaten the Coalition swimmers once, and that\u2019s only thanks to Matt Thistlethwaite, and we\u2019ve never beaten the Press Gallery team. \n   Chris and I have spent many hours with our arms around our colleagues when they needed professional and personal support. \n   That\u2019s something that people don\u2019t see. There is just so much about this place that people don\u2019t see. \n   There have been many speakers in my time here, and a few unusual ones. \n   You, Mr Speaker, have been far too patient with me when I\u2019m being cheeky or shouting something inappropriate. \n   To you, and all the staff of the Parliament, my thanks. \n   The dozens and dozens of staff I\u2019ve had over the years have been renowned for their kindness, their brilliance, their commitment to Labor values, and \u2026 their incredible fertility.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.26am GMT \n \n \n  5.20am GMT  \n  \n  If you are wondering what happened to the Michaelia Cash estimates updates, the committee has moved on to the spending of the department.  \n  \n Updated at 5.22am GMT \n \n \n  5.10am GMT  \n  \n  Jenny Macklin is delivering her valedictory speech, after 23 years in parliament. \n  To her colleagues she says: \n   \n   You are the custodians of our democracy now. And our democracy really must be nurtured. \n   In my first speech I spoke about citizenship.  \n   I said it wasn\u2019t just about having a vote or holding a passport. It means being able to share in the life of the community. It means enjoying a certain level of security. It means belonging. \n   The truth is, we need each other. We need to look out for each other, protect each other, and protect the institutions that bind us together. \n   There are some things in life we should all be able to rely on. \n   We all deserve to know that no matter what \u2013 old or young, city or bush, rich or poor \u2013 we\u2019ll be able to lead good, meaningful lives full of purpose. \n   That Australians everywhere can afford to see a doctor. \n   That the children I met in Fitzroy Crossing get the same chance at a great education as children in Melbourne. \n   That pensioners in West Heidelberg can have dignity and security in retirement, just like others. \n   That my children\u2019s generation can fulfil the dream of home ownership. \n   Each of us is subject to the twists and turns of fate. Our social safety net is there to protect everyone \u2013 and everyone deserves the security of knowing it\u2019s there when they need it. \n   If these fundamentals of Australian life break down, or only exist for the better off, then our social fabric breaks down. \n   The same goes for our national institutions.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.15am GMT \n \n \n  5.07am GMT  \n  \n  We haven\u2019t done this for a little bit, but I just went back through the Hansard to count how many times the word \u2018weak\u2019 has featured in Coalition questions or answers this week. \n  At my count \n  Monday \u2013 9 \n  Tuesday \u2013 12 \n  Wednesday \u2013 17 \n  \n Updated at 5.07am GMT \n \n \n  5.04am GMT  \n  \n  The navy has flagged all of Australia\u2019s ageing Collins class submarines may need upgrading before the new fleet of French-built vessels are operational. \n  \u201cWe are yet to fully determine how many of the boats we will upgrade,\u201d the navy chief, Mike Noonan, told a Senate estimates in hearing in Canberra on Wednesday. \n  \u201cWe\u2019re expecting that we will upgrade at least five.\u201d \n  The first of the new subs is supposed to be delivered by Naval Group in the early 2030s, with the final sub delivered in the 2050s. \n  Defence had previously planned to retire the six Collins subs around 2026. \n  The foreign minister, Marise Payne, who was previously defence minister, also claimed credit for naming the new submarines the \u201cattack class\u201d. \n  \n \n \n  4.48am GMT  \n  \n   \n   \n    Hugs in the chamber. @drkerrynphelps gets a hug from Anne Aly. @AmyRemeikis @mpbowers pic.twitter.com/n1pg467qbm\u2014 Lyndal Curtis (@lyndalcurtis) February 20, 2019\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  4.46am GMT  \n  \n  Jenny Macklin will deliver her valedictory speech very shortly, after which, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer will deliver hers.  \n  \n \n \n  4.45am GMT  \n  \n  For those asking, all of the crossbench, except Bob Katter, who was not in the chamber, voted with Labor to suspend standing orders. \n  Labor had lost three MPs (I think) to 94a \n  \n \n \n  4.39am GMT  \n  \n  Ayes - 71 \n  Noes - 71 \n  But there is no absolute majority, so the motion fails.  \n  And Scott Morrison calls an end to question time. \n  \n \n \n  4.32am GMT  \n  \n  Mark Dreyfus takes his opportunity to speak on the motion and then the time for debate is concluded. \n  A division is called. \n  Suspending standing orders takes an absolute majority (I am pretty sure) which is 76. \n  So Labor is unlikely to win this one.  \n  \n Updated at 4.58am GMT \n \n \n  4.28am GMT  \n  \n   \n   \n    The opposition leader @billshortenmp enjoys a quip from Labor frontbencher @JEChalmers during his suspension motion on #helloworld @AmyRemeikis @mpbowers pic.twitter.com/EDBjAq1ow9\u2014 Lyndal Curtis (@lyndalcurtis) February 20, 2019\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  4.27am GMT  \n  \n  Here is that Helloworld statement to the ASX Christopher Pyne was talking about: \n   \n   Helloworld Travel Limited (ASX: HLO) provides the following information in relation to media reports today: \n   Travel Services in the United States \n   This morning an article appeared in the Age and Sydney Morning Herald suggesting the Australian Ambassador to the United States, the Hon Joe Hockey \u201cpushed for a contract\u201d (print version) or \u201crequested a meeting\u201d (revised online version) with Helloworld subsidiary QBT in relation to the provision of travel services to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) in the United States. \n   QBT was awarded a contract in 2015 to provide travel management services to Commonwealth Government Agencies, including DFAT. \n   In 2017, QBT requested a meeting with DFAT personnel in the United States to discuss the provision of travel management services in the US and this meeting took place. \n   QBT understands DFAT personnel met a number of travel services providers as part of its considerations in relation to the provision of travel services in the United States. \n   In August 2018, DFAT started a formal tender process, which QBT has responded to. No announcement has been made in relation to this tender. \n   At no time has Ambassador Hockey or Helloworld CEO Andrew Burnes discussed the DFAT tender and neither Mr Hockey nor Mr Burnes have had any involvement in the tender process.  \n   Mr Burnes did not request the meeting with DFAT personnel in the United States. \n   At all times Helloworld and Mr Burnes have acted properly in the tender process. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.00am GMT \n \n \n  4.25am GMT  \n  \n  Christopher Pyne: \n   \n   Now, let\u2019s just turn to this issue itself \u2013 this pathetic case that was put by the member for Rankin \u2013 the facts are, Mr Speaker, the ambassador in Washington declared his shareholding in Helloworld before the tender process for the Australian embassy in Washington travel services began.* \n   The tender process commenced with a register for expressions of interest advertised in August 2018. Mr Hockey has had no role in the tender process.  \n   He declared his business interests in accordance with the DFAT guidelines. \n   The Australian embassy staff meeting with QBT on 26 April 2017 was not in relation to the tender process. QBT was then and continues to be a travel provider for DFAT through whole-of-government supplier arrangements.  \n   Mr Hockey declared his business interests in Helloworld to embassy staff ahead of that meeting. He did not instruct staff to meet QBT or any other companies in relation to the tender.  \n   As part of the normal business, Australian embassy staff have met and corresponded with a range of travel providers to discuss the embassy\u2019s travel requirements. They are the facts, Mr Speaker.  \n   And Helloworld has put out a statement today to the Australian Stock Exchange, not to the Guardian, not to the ABC, not to the Fairfax press, not to the Labor party machine men who are trying to distract the Australian public from their complete failure on border protection and taxes, no, to the Australian Stock Exchange.  \n   So it\u2019s a very high standard required if you declare something to the Australian Stock Exchange. But I tell you what they declared \u2013 they said at no time has embassy Hockey or Helloworld CEO Andrew Burnes discussed the DFAT tender and neither Mr Hockey nor Mr Burns have had any involvement in the tender process.\u201d \n   \n  *Just a thought \u2013 how did that conversation come up?

Mr Speaker, that was really one of the weakest performances I have seen in this place for a very long time. \n   This is the man who is apparently the great white hope of the Queensland right-wing, Mr Speaker.  \n   His performance was enough to make himself cry, Mr Speaker. As we know, it\u2019s been the case before in the past when he hasn\u2019t been able to get his own way, Mr Speaker, as was exposed by the previous prime minister, Mr Rudd.  \n   This is one of the most \u2013 the weakest cases I have ever seen in this House, Mr Speaker, to condemn either a minister or in this case the ambassador to Washington DC.  \n   It is a straight out smear and a straight out slur, Mr Speaker, and what the Labor party have been saying in the press gallery all day today to anybody who wanted to hear, bragging about how they have had this story for months, they have known about the Helloworld story for a long time and they were just waiting to drop it to distract from their own problems, Mr Speaker. \n   To distract from their woes which they have created themselves in the last few weeks. They thought they were coming back to Canberra.  \n   ... But they completely mistake the fact that the Canberra bubble is not the Australian public. That is not what the people of Australia are talking about, Mr Speaker.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.22am GMT \n \n \n  4.15am GMT  \n  \n  Lyndal Curtis is having some fun: \n   \n   \n    Labor MP @NickChampionMP attempts to ask a question about #helloworld for the second time. @AmyRemeikis @mpbowers pic.twitter.com/aES4CBz6Yd\u2014 Lyndal Curtis (@lyndalcurtis) February 20, 2019\n    \n   \n   \n   \n    Minister @cpyne is happy to be handballed an opposition question on Joe Hockey by the PM #qt @AmyRemeikis @mpbowers pic.twitter.com/Q7OLWaL5E2\u2014 Lyndal Curtis (@lyndalcurtis) February 20, 2019\n    \n   \n   \n   \n    Labor MP @AmandaRishworth seems not unhappy about being ejected from #qt @AmyRemeikis @mpbowers pic.twitter.com/PooJUl1Ees\u2014 Lyndal Curtis (@lyndalcurtis) February 20, 2019\n    \n   \n   \n   \n    The DPM, @M_McCormackMP , encouraging children to stay at school and study history instead of protesting. #qt @AmyRemeikis @mpbowers pic.twitter.com/w2JZk5mgYD\u2014 Lyndal Curtis (@lyndalcurtis) February 20, 2019\n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.23am GMT \n \n \n  4.14am GMT  \n  \n  Jim Chalmers is now attempting to suspend standing orders on the same issue. \n   \n   ...

The alternative universe when you don\u2019t actually notice when somebody picks up a $3,000 tab for you.  \n   You haven\u2019t noticed it comes out of your credit card. The alternative universe those opposite occupy where there is one set of rules for their rich Liberal party mates and another set of rules for ordinary Australians and communities that we represent right around this country.  \n   Now there are so many things today, Mr Speaker, that the prime minister and his sidekick, his offsider, the member for Sturt, were unable to explain.  \n   So many things they were unable to explain. They couldn\u2019t provide a simple answer to a simple question about whether the documents which prove that Mr Hockey asked one of the embassy officials to take a meeting with a company \u2013 the company at the centre of this scandal \u2013 whether or not that document exists, and when the member for Sturt was asked about this, he basically told the House, \u2018Look, when we get around to checking it out, we\u2019ll see how we go.\u2019 Well, that\u2019s not good enough.  \n   That\u2019s not good enough \u2013 the Australian people deserve answers about this latest grubby scandal which is engulfing the government which sits opposite \u2013 opposite from us today. \n   ... There are so many aspects to this, but perhaps the one that the prime minister needs to explain from his own answers today, I think \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of explaining to do from the prime minister, there\u2019s a lot of explaining that he needs to do.  \n   But he said today, and he scurried out of the House, he has gone and hid in his office, but he said today, \u2018I\u2019m advised Mr Hockey did not instruct staff to meet QBT or any other companies in relation to the tender and as part of normal business\u2019, and what the prime minister needs to explain, when he speaks, when he next speaks, or when the member for Sturt does, is that he is claiming that Mr Hockey didn\u2019t request embassy staff to meet with QBT at all. Now, this is a very serious issue here, this is a very serious issue. \n    The prime minister is denying something ... of which there are reports of documents which exist from officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. That is a very, very serious matter, Mr Speaker, and that\u2019s why we need to suspend standing orders to get to the bottom of these very, very important issues.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.28am GMT \n \n \n  4.07am GMT  \n  \n  Jim Chalmers is attempting to move this motion: \n   \n   I seek leave to move the following motion \u2013 that the House,  \n   one, notes that yesterday it was revealed the finance minister received free flights to Singapore from Helloworld, which he booked by calling the CEO of this ASX-listed company directly, just before it was awarded a multimillion-dollar whole-of-government contract by the minister\u2019s own department,  \n   (b) today, it has been reported that US ambassador Joe Hockey, who has a million-dollar shareholding in Helloworld, helped a Helloworld subsidiary lobby for the embassy\u2019s travel contract,  \n   (c) the CEO of Helloworld and one of its largest shareholders, Andrew Burnes, is a Liberal party heavyweight and currently Liberal party treasurer with connections to a number of Liberal party politicians,  \n   (d) the finance minister told Senate estimates yesterday that he had \u201ca close personal relationship\u201d with Mr Burnes,  \n   (e) Mr Burnes was previously a colleague of the now-prime minister during the prime minister\u2019s time at Tourism Australia,  \n   (f) since being awarded government contracts, the share price of Helloworld has skyrocketed, making shareholders like Mr Hockey and Mr Burns rich,  \n   and (g) it was reported that the Herald Sun asked almost all of the 82 Liberal MPs in parliament whether they had received free travel from Helloworld, but only 14 said that they had not,  \n   and, (2) therefore calls on the prime minister to investigate and report to the House how far this Helloworld scandal reaches into his government. \n   \n  He is denied on the voices.  \n  \n Updated at 4.19am GMT \n \n \n  4.01am GMT  \n  \n  Jim Chalmers with the Nick Champion question (just cut down) to Scott Morrison: \n  Is the prime minister confident that trips like the one by the minister for home affairs and Joe Hockey with Helloworld\u2019s CEO and Liberal treasurer Mr Andrew Burnes to Las Vegas, were paid at the full commercial rate? \n  Morrison: \n   \n   Again, Mr Speaker, the member comes here and just makes assertions ... \n   He makes ... and then he asks me to respond as if those assertions are true, Mr Speaker. No, he is not asking \u2013 it is said to me, how dare he answer the question, he is not asking a question, he is making an assertion about something he hasn\u2019t even established as a fact and on that basis, Mr Speaker, I don\u2019t agree necessarily with the presumption of the question and therefore, on what basis should I allow a member to come and simply just come to the despatch box, cast aspersions on people in this chamber and the other chamber and former members of the chamber simply because the Labor party wants to distract attention from the fact they\u2019ve come into this place and undermined Australia\u2019s border protection regime, Mr Speaker?  \n   We know, because they\u2019ve been boasting around the media for some time, that they have had this little issue for some time in the drawer and when the pressure is on, they pull it out. \n   \n  He finishes before Tony Burke can ask him about relevance. \n  \n Updated at 4.31am GMT \n \n \n  3.59am GMT  \n  \n  Josh Frydenberg is now referencing sledgehammers and now I have Peter Gabriel stuck in my head and there is NO excuse for that. \n  \n Updated at 4.32am GMT \n \n \n  3.57am GMT  \n  \n  Josh Frydenberg is now talking about a couple who \u201cplucked up the courage\u201d to buy a two-bedroom apartment. \n  Not all heroes wear capes, people. \n  \n \n \n  3.56am GMT  \n  \n  Christian Porter takes a dixer where he makes reference to a \u201cring of steel\u201d and I just can not. \n  Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: \n   \n   Nine reports, and I quote, \u2018In Mr Hockey\u2019s case, DFAT documents seen by the Age and Sydney Morning Herald show that he asked embassy staff to set up a meeting between minister councillor Justin Phillips who oversees the embassy\u2019s operations and an executive from Helloworld Sydney Qantas Business travel.\u201d  \n   Does the prime minister deny such documents exist? \n   \n  Christopher Pyne takes this one, but with permission first this time. \n   \n   The prime minister was asked about conflict of interest in that question and let me say this about conflict of interest \u2013 the Labor party, since we got into power in 2013, have opposed every single attempt we have made to make the unions accountable in this country, Mr Speaker.\u201d \n   \n  He\u2019s told that is not the question. So he starts again. \n   \n   Well, thank you, Mr Speaker, and if such documents exist, and if such reports exist, I\u2019m sure that we can find those things out when we actually investigate the efficacy of this question, Mr Speaker, and I\u2019m not going to simply accept on face value that because the opposition says something, it makes it true, Mr Speaker. \n   We see time and time again that in fact that is not the case \u2013 that the Labor party take long bows, exaggerations, use all sorts of means to try and twist the truth, and I\u2019ve seen that for a quarter of a century in this place. So I\u2019m hardly going to simply accept what the member for Rankin says, and respond to it as though it\u2019s factual. \n   But I was asked \u2013 I thought generally the question was an implication of conflict of interest, Mr Speaker. Conflict of interest of our ambassador in Washington, DC and, as I said before in my answer, the government has absolute confidence in our ambassador in Washington, DC, and we\u2019re not going to take lectures from the Labor party about integrity in politics.\u201d \n   \n  He goes on to repeat his answer from the last question, but is sat down for straying off topic by Smith.  \n  \n Updated at 4.35am GMT \n \n \n  3.51am GMT  \n  \n  Channel 7 host Larry Emdur\u2019s recent half-hour flight in a fighter jet was worth about $8,000. \n  Emdur underwent flight training and dressed up in a fighter pilot\u2019s uniform for a segment on the Morning Show and was accompanied by the defence minister, Christopher Pyne, at an Australian air force base. \n   \n   \n    Here's a sneak peek of @larryemdur's top secret mission with @cpyne! \u2708\ufe0f #TMS7 pic.twitter.com/PKnvbmwvEV\u2014 The Morning Show (@morningshowon7) February 18, 2019\n    \n   \n  \u201cIt\u2019s the most amazing thing I\u2019ve done in my life,\u201d Emdur said. \n  A fighter pilot tells Emdur in the footage if he throws up in the jet he has to clean it up. \n   \n   \n    Move over, Maverick!

Without the nod from the prime minister.  \n   \n   I represent the minister for foreign affairs in the House of Representatives, so I\u2019ll answer this question. \n   \n  Tony Smith:  \n   \n   No, just before \u2013 no, I\u2019m not satisfied with that. I mean, I need to... \n   \n  Scott Morrison gives the nod. \n  Pyne:  \n   \n   Happy to take the question, prime minister. \n   We always check. We always check every single claim the Labor party make about any sort of report, especially in the media, before we decide whether it\u2019s fact or not, that has been our tradition in this place. \n   I can tell you, Mr Speaker, as the minister who represents the minister for foreign affairs, we have every confidence in Joe Hockey as our ambassador in Washington, DC.  \n   He is a former distinguished member of this House. \n   He is a former distinguished treasurer. He is a great \u2013 he did a great deal more to get this economy back on track than any member the Labor party ever had and one of the reasons we are reaping the benefits today of budget surpluses and a strong economy is because of the work that Joe Hockey did when he was a distinguished member of this House, Mr Speaker. \n   (That was not the question) \n   So first point I would make ... is that we have every confidence in the integrity of Joe Hockey, our ambassador in Washington. The second point I would make is we have absolutely no confidence in the integrity of many members of the Labor party over the many years that I have been in this place and to be lectured \u2013 to be lectured by the Labor party about fiscal rectitude, the party of Eddie Obeid, the party of Joe Triponi, the party of Rex Jackson, if you want to go back a few decades, Mr Speaker... \n   The party who required a royal commission, a royal commission, to get out of the leader of the opposition a donation that he had forgotten all about, Mr Speaker. It took eight years, the party of John Setker, Mr Speaker, who they revere and put into a position of importance in the Labor party. The party of Ian Macdonald. There were almost as many people in prison... \n   So we will not be lectured by the Labor party about integrity or fiscal rectitude in this place and we all know what\u2019s going on here. The prime minister nailed it earlier. The Labor party have had a shocker of a couple of weeks, Mr Speaker.  \n   They thought the big story out of this fortnight would be the Canberra bubble, would be about votes in the House of Representatives, who was up and who was down. But it isn\u2019t, Mr Speaker.  \n   The story out of this fortnight is that Labor is weak on border protection and cannot be trusted...\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.05am GMT \n \n \n  3.42am GMT  \n  \n  Nick Champion to Scott Morrison: \n   \n   Yesterday, it was revealed the finance minister received free flights to Singapore from Helloworld just before it was awarded a multimillion-dollar whole-of-government contract by the minister\u2019s own department and today it was reported that US ambassador Joe Hockey, who has a million-dollar shareholding in Helloworld, helped a Helloworld subsidiary lobby for embassy travel contracts. Is the prime minister confident that trips like the one by the Minister for Home Affairs and Joe Hockey ... \n   \n  He doesn\u2019t finish. Tony Smith says there is no question there. \n  Wayne Swan says he couldn\u2019t hear the question and there was \u201cclearly\u201d an issue. Smith lets him ask the question again. Champion RUSHES it out. \n  But he doesn\u2019t get the question out in time. \n  \u201cNo issue with the microphone there, and again there was no question,\u201d Smith rules. \n  We move on to Ian Goodenough\u2019s dixer. \n  Josh Frydenberg congratulates him on \u201cbeing able to ask a question properly\u201d. \n  \u201cThat\u2019s how you do it!\u201d a government MP yells out. So loudly I can hear it through the broadcast. \n  I\u2019m not sure that is the compliment they think it is, though. \n  \n Updated at 4.40am GMT \n \n \n  3.37am GMT  \n  \n  Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: \n   \n   Can the prime minister confirm reports that US ambassador Joe Hockey was contacted by Helloworld\u2019s CEO and Liberal party treasurer Andrew Burnes. Mr Hockey then directed embassy staff to meet with the Helloworld to discuss travel arrangements and the embassy staff were not aware of Joe Hockey\u2019s interest in Helloworld until after that meeting had taken place. Is the prime minister seriously telling the Australian people that this behaviour is completely acceptable? \n   \n  Morrison: \n   \n   Again, the member is misrepresenting the truth. He does this constantly. His mentor up there [Wayne Swan] misrepresented the truth when he said he was going to deliver four surpluses, Mr Speaker, and they turned out to be deficits.  \n   The prince of deficits is leaving the chamber, Mr Speaker, sadly. He is leaving the chamber, but I wish him all the best in his retirement.  \n   Mr Speaker, I can advise the Australian embassy staff meeting ... on 26 April 2017, I\u2019m advised, was not in relation to the tender process.  \n   QBT was then, and continues to be, a travel agency for DFAT through a whole-of-government supply arrangement. Mr Joe Hockey declared his interest in Helloworld to embassy staff ahead of the meeting.  \n   I\u2019m advised embassy staff did not meet QBT or other staff in relation to the tender and embassy staff have met and corresponded with a whole range of travel providers to discuss the embassy\u2019s travel requirements.  \n   So, Mr Speaker, what this is, just again, is the Labor party trying to distract attention with all these slurs, all these smears, all these grubby claims, Mr Speaker, because ... they know they have been caught out doing the wrong thing by the Australian people and well outside this bubble here, Mr Speaker, whether it is out in Penrith or up in Townsville or over in Bunbury, they know one thing and that is the Labor party cannot be trusted on border protection because the leader of the Labor party is a weak soul when it comes to this issue, Mr Speaker.  \n   He cannot be trusted and his party is riven and divided on the issue of border protection.  \n   Only today \u2013 only today, we had the deputy leader of the opposition agreeing with the member for Wentworth, who had said \u2013 now, I wouldn\u2019t suggest the member for Wentworth take geography lessons from the member for Sydney, Mr Speaker, that said these people should not come to ... Christmas Island, they should come to Australia, Mr Speaker. They should come to \u2013 they shouldn\u2019t come to Christmas Island, they should come to Australia. Now, I can see the member for Sydney agrees with that, Mr Speaker ... but honestly they should be taken to a place, Mr Speaker, where we can be sure that any persons who come to this place who shouldn\u2019t be are held in detention. \n   \n  He finishes, but Tony Smith issues a warning for answers to stay on subject matter. \n  \n Updated at 5.07am GMT \n \n \n  3.32am GMT  \n  \n  Senator Derryn Hinch has offered this critique of Michaelia Cash\u2019s evidence: \u201cIt sounds like a round robin. You tell Senate estimates it\u2019s before the courts, you told the police you told Senate estimates. It sounds like a round-robin.\u201d \n  Cash responded: \u201cNo, I actually answered copious questions [in Senate estimates]\u201d. She said after she provided the AFP with a transcript of her evidence in Senate estimates, they \u201cdidn\u2019t have further questions\u201d even though they \u201chad every opportunity\u201d to ask follow-ups. \n  Hinch then asks if in a meeting with Malcolm Turnbull and two staffers (including former chief of staff Ben Davies) whether either of them piped up when she denied knowledge of the leaks. Cash takes the question on notice, to check the estimates transcript about what she\u2019s already said on the topic. \n  \n Updated at 5.08am GMT \n \n \n  3.29am GMT  \n  \n  Josh Frydenberg talks about all the poor, poor retirees on Australia\u2019s \u201clowest (*coughs TAXABLE*) incomes\u201d. \n  We move on. \n  Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: \n   \n   Today, it has been reported that US ambassador Joe Hockey, who has a million-dollar shareholding in Helloworld, helped them lobby for the travel contract. How can it possibly be appropriate for Joe Hockey to use his official position as his ambassador to help Helloworld win a government contract? Why does this Liberal government only ever look after itself and its mates at the top end of town? \n   \n  Morrison: \n   \n   I can advise that \u2013 I\u2019m advised that Mr Joe Hockey declared his shareholding in Helloworld before the tender process ... \n   ... The tender process commenced with the register for expressions of interest advertised in August 2018. Mr Hockey has had no role in the tender process. He has declared his business interests in accordance with DFAT guidelines. \n    So, Mr Speaker, this is just another grubby attempt by the Labor party to distract attention from one very simple thing ... they know they have made a very big mistake in showing up the weakness of their own leader by forcing him to back down ... \n   By forcing the Labor leader to back down to them and come into this place and weaken Australia\u2019s border security arrangements and they can come in here and throw all the mud they like but one thing will be known well outside the Canberra bubble, that is when it comes to border protection, you can\u2019t trust Labor, Mr Speaker.  \n   You cannot trust Labor and I\u2019ll tell you why \u2013 it\u2019s because they are so divided on the issue of border protection. This is why they failed so badly in government. They could not agree on this issue from one day to the next, and that\u2019s why you can\u2019t trust Labor.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.10am GMT \n \n \n  3.25am GMT  \n  \n  Adam Bandt has the crossbench question. And he uses it to troll Michael McCormack: \n   \n   Climate change poses massive risks to Australia\u2019s infrastructure including from rising sea levels, floods that are more intense and bushfires like we\u2019ve already seen this year. Deputy prime minister, will you join me in congratulating the courageous school students going on strike on 15 March, right around the country, calling for urgent climate action and the protection of Australia\u2019s infrastructure?  \n   Will you commend these young people and the 15,000 who went on strike last November, for taking time off school to show us what real leadership looks like?\u201d \n   \n  McCormack (it ... goes places. And we learn just how bad McCormacking can be, when he doesn\u2019t have a script.) \n   \n   Well, I tell you what, real leadership doesn\u2019t look like anything that the member for Melbourne brings to this chamber, Mr Speaker.  \n   The children should be at school, that\u2019s where they should be.  \n   They should be learning about Australian history, they should be learning about Australian geography, they should be learning about all the lessons that their teachers are willing to teach them.  \n   Mr Speaker, they should be at school, and I\u2019m pleased ... that I\u2019m part of a government that\u2019s spending record funding on schools, Mr Speaker.  \n   Record funding on public schools, record funding on schools in general, Mr Speaker, and the member for Melbourne would do far better off, Mr Speaker, advising those children to go to school and to stay at school.  \n   What would happen \u2013 who\u2019s going to look after those kids when they\u2019re out protesting? I know the Greens like to protest, because that\u2019s all you ever bring to the national debate is protests and frivolous rallies.  \n   You\u2019d do far better off joining the Liberal and the National parties in talking about the economic narrative, in talking about how important it is to have a job in this country, because if you want to work in this country, well, there\u2019s a job there for you.  \n   You\u2019d be far better off talking about our record investment in defence and not siding with those on that side who, when they had six years of opportunity, dropped our defence investment spending levels to 1.6% of GDP, down to the same levels of appeasement and I don\u2019t know why the member for Greenway is complaining or laughing \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s no laughing matter. \n   It\u2019s important that we spend money on defence. It\u2019s important that our defence people have the very best of equipment.\u201d \n   \n  Here, even Tony Smith has reached his limit. \n   \n   I\u2019m going to say the deputy prime minister was asked a question with a number of elements, but straying into defence is not relevant to the question. The deputy prime minister can resume his answer but he needs to be relevant to the question.\u201d \n   \n  McCormack, carries on. \n  \u201cThe best place for those children is at school learning about Australian history, learning about all the important things that their teachers, our very best teachers, mind you ...\u201d \n  Bandt interjects on relevance to ask if McCormack could explain what the students could do with the science they learn in school. \n  McCormack: \n   \n   [The member has been here] long enough to know he can\u2019t introduce new material into a question, so you can\u2019t have two goes, you can\u2019t have two goes, but I\u2019m proud to be part of a government that invests in teachers \u2013 quality teachers. My daughter is a quality teacher and I tell you what, Mr Speaker, so too are our teachers and you know what, they should be in class, they should be teaching our children, the very best children, and I tell you what, yeah, they\u2019re up there, too, well done for pointing them out, good on you. \n   Well, I tell you what, I hope they don\u2019t learn too many sentences from you, the member for McMahon, because you haven\u2019t brought much to the national debate lately, and when they get old I hope you\u2019ve got nothing to do with their franking credits and negative gearing.

Who\u2019s telling the truth - the prime minister or the police? Because both can\u2019t be correct. \n  Morrison: \n   \n   Mr Speaker, there\u2019s another option, and that is the member who asked the question is not representing the truth of these proceedings, Mr Speaker, which is no surprise. \n   No surprise whatsoever. Because, as I said yesterday, at no stage after the statements that were requested by the AFP was - and that was provided - I advised that further information and advice that the statement was provided was insufficient, Mr Speaker, and what I can tell you is that the AFP has acknowledged the receipt of both the correspondence from Minister Keenan and from Minister Cash and in relation to Minister Keenan he said, \u201cI acknowledge receipt of your statement, AFP will review the statement and if we require any further clarification we may reach out to you.\u201d  \n   That was the end of the matter, Mr Speaker. \n   ... My ministers cooperated with the requirements of the AFP, and the ... \n   ... Mr Speaker, the simple explanation is this.

Cameron clarifies he is talking about criminal \u201cactivity\u201d, even if it hasn\u2019t resulted in charges and proceedings. \n  Cash said she had no discussions with then justice minister Michael Keenan about the raids, and rejects the suggestion that there was \u201ca conspiracy between ministers\u201d. \n  Asked about whether she was aware that her chief of staff Ben Davieswas involved (the federal court heard he told her former senior media adviser about the warrants), Cash replied:  \n  \u201cThe evidence I gave on Friday was clear: I had no prior knowledge of the raids, of the execution of warrants. Other than what I\u2019ve seen in media reports, I have no way to verify if that\u2019s true, that would be the first time [I learned about that], reading the media reports.\u201d \n  \n Updated at 3.23am GMT \n \n \n  3.07am GMT  \n  \n  All this dixer has taught me is that Scott Morrison is once again yelling in question time.  \n  \n \n \n  3.05am GMT  \n Question time begins \n  \n  Cathy O\u2019Toole to Scott Morrison: \n  Townsville has experienced our worst natural disaster in our recorded history. The devastating flood has affected more than 22,000 homes. Why won\u2019t the prime minister schedule extra sitting days so this parliament can pass laws to make insurance companies treat north Queenslanders fairly? When will the prime minister stop listening to the insurers and start listening to the people of north Queensland? \n  Morrison says the government has worked quickly to provide an immediate response, including financial support. But he will not be scheduling extra sitting days. \n  After a point of order on relevance from Tony Burke, he addresses the insurance part of the question (and links it to border protection): \n  \u201c... Specifically on the matter of insurance that is one of the many issues that the government is dealing with as part of the ministerial task force in our response to the flood crisis in northern Queensland and the assistant treasurer has been working on those issues and I can assure you that the insurance companies are on notice from our government that they need to address the claims and they need to be standing with the people of north Queensland in the same way that our government is doing just that, Mr Speaker.  \n  I\u2019m very disappointed that the government has been put in the situation where we have to spend $500m in the next two years opening a detention centre which we didn\u2019t need to do two weeks ago, Mr Speaker, and the only reason we have to do that is because the leader of the Labor party has no interest in border protection. \n  \n Updated at 3.10am GMT \n \n \n  2.54am GMT  \n  \n   \n   \n    or we could just scrap the taxpayer funded religious chaplaincy program altogether...

One has to wonder what is in the documents the [Australian Federal Police] have seized from the AWU that they are fighting tooth and nail to ensure the [registered organisations] commission and Australian public never ever see? I wonder if the documents show Mr Shorten did not have the authorisations?\u201d \n  Cash also rejected the suggestion she had been \u201cdemoted\u201d by noting that she is still a cabinet minister, a \u201cprivilege\u201d that Cameron has never and will never have (as he\u2019s leaving parliament at next election). \n  \n Updated at 2.53am GMT \n \n \n  2.48am GMT  \n  \n  Michaelia Cash has STILL not seen a transcript of the AFP evidence and says she will not comment on what was said, until she has seen it.  \n  \n \n \n  2.47am GMT  \n  \n  We are also in the downhill slide to question time. \n  \n \n \n  2.43am GMT  \n  \n  Michaelia Cash is now taking umbrage at Doug Cameron saying last night that she was demoted. \n  She says that she is a cabinet minister, which is a privilege that Cameron will never have. And she is \u201cdelighted\u201d to be the minister for small and family business.  \n  \n \n \n  2.42am GMT  \n  \n  Labor foreign affairs spokeswoman Penny Wong has held a press conference to attack the Coalition\u2019s handling of the $50bn future submarine program. \n  She said: \n  \u201cBefore the last election [defence minister] Christopher Pyne told South Australians that the local build, the local content, the Australian content would be 90%.... then that became 60%. \n  \u201cGuess what we learned today in Senate estimates: there is no minimum Australian content for our submarines program. No minimum amount of Australian jobs ... utterly contrary to the promises made by Christopher Pyne and others before the election.\u201d \n  \n Updated at 2.48am GMT \n \n \n  2.42am GMT  \n  \n  Michaelia Cash has come in with a statement that points to it all being Bill Shorten\u2019s fault. \n  She also points out that Joe Ludwig cost the Commonwealth almost $800,000 in legal fees. \n  Except \u2013 that was when the cattle industry sued him. Which is a little different to what we are looking at today. \n  \n Updated at 2.48am GMT \n \n \n  2.37am GMT  \n  \n  Michaelia Cash has turned up in the education and employment estimates. \n  Doug Cameron is thrilled.  \n  \n \n \n  2.27am GMT  \n Schools to choose if they want a chaplain under Labor \n  \n  What about the chaplains program? Tanya Plibersek says Labor will go back to a \u2018school\u2019s choice\u2019 position. \n   \n   This is one of those policy areas that\u2019s gone back and forward with every change of government and we will go back to the position we had when we were last in government, the funding remains.  \n   Schools can choose to employ chaplains if they wish. Or they can choose to employ a secular youth worker, social worker, someone with adequate qualifications to give support, mentoring, deliver social welfare in the students.  \n   When it comes to the teachers, I wouldn\u2019t want the school chaplaincy program paying for that.  \n   But one of the benefits of the $14bn in additional funding that we will give to public schools and the restoration of funding to Catholic and independent schools is you can hire more specialist teachers to reduce some of the workload on teachers and continuing professional development, feeling like you are on top of what you are doing incredibly reduces your stress load.  \n   Most of the extra funding that needs-based funding brought to our schools last time was doing that, it was bringing in specialist teaching, extra teacher aids, it was giving teachers more one-on-one time with students.  \n   It was giving more opportunity for professional development so that people felt confident in the classroom.  \n   I will give you an example. If you are a teacher who has never taught someone with a particular disability and an eight-year-old comes in that year and you really want to do the best for this child, having the opportunity to be, to get some training, to get some mentoring, to work with other teachers to work out how to best teach that child \u2013 that changes \u2013 it makes the teaching a joy rather than something that\u2019s keeping you awake at night. That is the sort of opportunity we want to give our teachers.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.32am GMT \n \n \n  2.25am GMT  \n  \n  Asked again about Adani, Tanya Plibersek gives the response we were talking about a little earlier: \n   \n   Well, we\u2019ve been very clear about our position. We say first of all that there is no way we would give $1bn of taxpayers\u2019 money to an Indian mining conglomerate to build this mine.  \n   Then we said the project would have to stack up on environmental and economic grounds. That is the way we make decisions about all projects. We don\u2019t make a case-by-case decision about how we feel about a particular project. We have rules, we have laws, we work through them and we make a sensible decision.  \n   The evidence that we\u2019ve seen so far is that the jobs claims of Adani are vastly overstated.  \n   We get that Central and North Queensland need jobs and that is why we\u2019ve committed hundreds of millions of dollars to investing in real infrastructure projects, port upgrades, airport upgrades, road upgrades, that really unlock the agriculture and tourism potential of those regions. As well as the jobs you get in construction in running the new facilities, you get greater access to the world for the products of central Central and north Queensland and greater access of the world to those regions for tourism.  \n   That is really important because that is real jobs, it is not the fake job promises that Adani keeps making and then letting us down on.  \n   Also, when it comes to environmental assessments, there are a number of outstanding environmental questions as you know about this particular project.  \n   I believe the royalties agreement hasn\u2019t been signed yet with the Queensland government. We\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see what happens. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.30am GMT \n \n \n  2.14am GMT  \n  \n  Tanya Plibersek has also been asked about Richard Marles\u2019s comments on thermal coal: \n   \n   The first thing to say about coal is it\u2019s not about how we feel about coal, it\u2019s not the vibe.  \n   There is a simple economic fact that the world is moving away from coal-fired power generation, it\u2019s becoming increasingly expensive, we\u2019ve recognised that global warming is a problem, we want to reduce our pollution, some countries are worried about the air quality in their cities.  \n   However you look at it, this is a change that is happening not just in our economy, but around the world. And how I feel about it is not the relevant issue. It is back to the data.  \n   The data shows us that renewables are becoming cheaper all the time. And to fantasise about building new coal-fired power stations with taxpayers\u2019 money as some of the Liberals and Nationals are doing, is irresponsible.\u201d \n   \n  And a little bit later, when asked about whether there is a divide within Labor on coal, she says this: \n   \n   I keep reading all these articles about differences of opinion and that\u2019s just not the case. We see the jobs in the coal industry at the moment as very important jobs and that\u2019s why we want to plan long term with affected communities for their future.  \n   What we have seen under this government is coal-fired power stations close with little or no warning, throwing people out of work, with no adjustment, no help to their communities.  \n   But the simple economics of power generation mean that renewables are getting cheaper all the time. We need to be alive to that.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.18am GMT \n \n \n  2.11am GMT  \n  \n  Tanya Plibersek has just been asked that very question at the press club: \n   \n   Your second question pretends there is some difference between Bill and I on the issue of asylum seekers - it is not true. \n   The proposition is absolutely false. But what I\u2019ll say - I\u2019ll say this: It is up to the government to explain how people who cannot be adequately treated on Manus Island and Nauru can have adequate medical treatment on Christmas Island.  \n   It is up to them to explain how that can happen. It is up to them to explain how they justify the extra expense of doing it this way given that this government has already brought hundreds of people from Manus Island and Nauru to Australia to the mainland for medical treatment.  \n   The last briefing we got, I think the security agency said the number of people who had been brought here for medical treatment by this government in recent times was close to 400.  \n   And the number of accompanying family members was something over 500.  \n   How can it be safe for those people to be brought here by Peter Dutton but we need to open Christmas Island for anybody else? I\u2019d like the government to explain that.\u201d \n   \n  \n \n \n  2.09am GMT  \n  \n  The Greens leader Richard Di Natale has a few things to say about Labor and the Christmas Island proposal: \n  Just when you begin to hope that the Labor Party was starting to find a backbone on refugees, Bill Shorten has gone to water,\u201d he said in a statement. \n  \u201cDespite his deputy saying the government\u2019s policy to transfer sick patients to Christmas island for treatment was \u2018difficult to understand\u2019 and his immigration spokesperson saying the reopening the centre was \u2018silly\u2019, Bill Shorten thinks it\u2019s \u2018fine\u2019. \n  \u201cBuying into Scott Morrison\u2019s propaganda that there is any need to reopen Christmas Island, or that it has the required medical facilities, is a failure of leadership.  \n  \u201cAll it took was a litle criticism from Peter Dutton and one bad poll result for Bill Shorten to get spooked and start aligning himself with the Liberal government on the issue again.  \n  \u201cA government that is determined to shun the will of the parliament and refuse to bring sick people here for treatment, deserves a strong opposition \u2013 not a benign collaborator.\u201d \n  \n Updated at 2.12am GMT \n \n \n  1.59am GMT  \n  \n  Departmental officials have defended monitoring social media for complaints about the contentious ParentsNext welfare program, saying they need to correct misinformation. \n  But they also revealed they have contacted participants\u2019 ParentsNext providers without telling them in order to examine complaints welfare recipients have posted on social media.  \n  Bureaucrats from the Department of Jobs and Small Business were asked at Senate Estimates on Wednesday about the case of single mother and welfare campaigner Ella Buckland, who told Guardian Australia a freedom of information request had shown officials were collecting \u201cbackground\u201d information about her.  \n  \u201cOur media coverage doesn\u2019t go to individuals \u2026 it goes to programs that we are running,\u201d deputy secretary Nathan Smyth told the hearing. \n  \u201cWe need to at times correct misinformation and at times brief ministers\u2019 offices about misinformation that might be out there around the program.\u201d \n  Department official Greg Manning said staff would only monitor material on social media that used a welfare program\u2019s name or tagged the department.  \n  Officials said they were \u201cnot trawling through posts on Twitter\u201d, but Manning said there were a small number of cases where they had contacted the providers of parents who had been critical of the program.  \n  \u201cI think Ms Buckland\u2019s been critical of an activity \u2026 we would go to the provider and go, is this right?\u201d Manning said.  \n  Normally, they would not tell the participant before contacting their provider, the hearing was told. \n  Siewert said that participants viewed that as an \u201cinvasion of privacy\u201d, particularly when the first time they were told about their personal social media posts was by their provider.  \n  \u201cPeople see it as the department being Big Brother,\u201d she said. \n  \n Updated at 2.07am GMT \n \n \n  1.58am GMT  \n  \n  Penny Wong and the South Australian Labor leader Peter Malinauskas (which is absolutely a Lithuanian name, if I am not mistaken.

Any proceeds will be donated to the Western Queensland Drought Appeal. \n   The reason I\u2019ve chosen to sell this tiny number of shares was Labor was using it as a distraction from the real issue \u2013 dairy farmers aren\u2019t getting paid a fair price for their milk. \n   The shares and their $15 return created absolutely no conflict of interest and I will continue to bash Coles and Aldi for their poor treatment of farmers, as well as Woolworths when they deserve it. I\u2019ll also criticise other companies I have shares in \u2013 Commonwealth Bank, ANZ and Telstra for instance \u2013 when they step out of line as I have for the two and a half years I\u2019ve been in politics. \n   Had I kept the 25 shares and their $15 return, some media would continue to give coverage to Labor highlighting me owning 25 Woolworths shares which returned $15 last year instead of the fact dairy farmers are not being paid fairly, and dairy farmers can\u2019t afford that.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.38am GMT \n \n \n  1.29am GMT  \n  \n   \n   \n    Looking forward to working with Ambassador Culvahouse downunder \ud83d\udc28\ud83e\udd98, and strengthening the historic Australia-US alliance together. \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 @SecPompeo @StateDept @dfat @USAembassyinOZ @JoeHockey @AmbJohnBolton @DepSecDef #Mateship https://t.co/svdjBdbLdL\u2014 Marise Payne (@MarisePayne) February 20, 2019\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  1.26am GMT  \n  \n  Tanya Plibersek is about to address the National Press Club. \n  She\u2019ll be talking about Labor\u2019s education policy. \n  \n \n \n  1.20am GMT  \n Welfare penalties 'distinction' \n  \n  Departmental officials are being grilled about the government\u2019s new welfare compliance regime, which came into effect in August. We covered that issue in some detail this morning with a story that revealed the new system had led to a 40% increase in payment suspensions.  \n  But as government senator Linda Reynolds tells the hearing, the number of financial \u201cpenalties\u201d has decreased dramatically \u2013 by about 95%.  \n  The distinction here is about the difference between a penalty (having a payment docked or cut completely), compared with a suspension, where payments are temporarily suspended until a welfare recipients \u201cre-engages\u201d.  \n  Greens senator Rachel Siewert says the distinction is a myth: \u201cAs far as the humans on this are concerned, a suspension is a penalty because it means they don\u2019t get access to any money.\u201d \n  The department confirms that of all people who\u2019ve received a financial penalty under the Jobactive program, one quarter were Indigenous. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a concern,\u201d the department\u2019s Nathan Smyth concedes. \n  It also hears that 52% of people considered homeless have received some sort of \u201cdemerit point\u201d \u2013 and therefore a payment \u201csuspension\u201d. More on that here.  \n  Reynolds says from the government\u2019s perspective \u201cthe numbers show that the (compliance regime) is actually working as intended\u201d. She says only 2% of Indigenous people on Jobactive go to the \u201cpenalty zone\u201d.  \n  \u201cThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s perfect,\u201d she adds. \n  \n Updated at 2.08am GMT \n \n \n  1.18am GMT  \n  \n  The nation\u2019s farmer\u2019s lobby is not totally opposed to Labor\u2019s idea of asking the ACCC to look at a floor price for milk.

So it has just gone for a largely hands-off approach.  \n  Which means it\u2019s a tricky issue for federal Labor, which has taken much the same path. \n  Labor remains united on no public funds for the mine. As for coal, it is attempting to straddle the middle road. Yes to renewables, but coal will still play its role. \n  Word from Labor is Marles\u2019s comments this morning are being considered \u201ca little clumsy\u201d given the sensitivity around coalmines in Queensland communities, that want them (and Labor wants their seats) but basically on message \u2013 let the market decide.  \n  \n Updated at 1.25am GMT \n \n \n  12.45am GMT  \n  \n  For those asking (and yes, I know there is a lot), Michaelia Cash is due back in estimates this afternoon. \n  You can find the program here  \n  \n Updated at 12.48am GMT \n \n \n  12.33am GMT  \n  \n   \n   \n    Resources Minister @mattjcan shedding light on his views on coal. @AmyRemeikis @mpbowers pic.twitter.com/0wc2nWagrU\u2014 Lyndal Curtis (@lyndalcurtis) February 20, 2019\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  12.27am GMT  \n  \n  David Littleproud has stood up on why the government voted against Labor\u2019s move to ask the ACCC to examine milk prices.

So welcome, Arthur B Culvahouse Jr. \n  \n Updated at 12.10am GMT \n \n \n  12.04am GMT  \n  \n  Conclusion \n   \n   It is in both nations\u2019 interests to have a secure and stable region, and the joint facilities and capabilities all play their role in ensuring regional security and stability is achieved. \n   But the alliance and regional stability cannot be taken for granted. \n   This government remains committed to growing and deepening all aspects of the relationship and working with the US to advance our mutual defence and security interests. \n   Our defence and intelligence cooperation will continue to evolve to meet ever-changing threats and challenges. As it must. \n   The spirit of innovation shared by our nations will continue to support the Australia-US alliance and continue to be our strength, as the alliance evolves now and into the future. \n   As we adapt to meet new challenges to the rules-based global order, our defence and intelligence cooperation and joint facilities will endure as our ever-vigilant eyes and ears in the world. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.08am GMT \n \n \n  12.03am GMT  \n  \n  Full knowledge and concurrence \u2013 protecting Australia\u2019s sovereignty \n   \n   While successive Australian governments have recognised the national security benefits that we gain from the joint facilities and by hosting US capabilities, they have also recognised that our national interests and sovereignty have to be honoured and protected. \n    \n    This has been achieved by our policy of full knowledge and concurrence.  \n    \n    \n    Full knowledge and concurrence is central to Australia hosting any foreign capability, be they from the US or any other country. \n    \n    \n    It is an expression of Australia\u2019s sovereignty and a fundamental right to know what activities foreign governments conduct on our soil. \n    \n    \n    \u201cFull knowledge\u201d equates to Australia having a full and detailed understanding of any capability or activity with a presence on Australian territory or making use of Australian assets.  \n    \n    \n    \u201cConcurrence\u201d means that Australia approves the presence of a capability or function in Australia, in support of mutually agreed goals. \n    \n    \n    That does not mean Australia approves each and every activity or tasking undertaken; rather, it means that Australia agrees to the purpose of activities conducted in Australia and also understands the outcomes of those activities. \n    \n    \n    But I can assure the parliament and the Australian public, we maintain appropriate levels of oversight for the activities undertaken. \n    \n    \n    Importantly, concurrence also means that Australia can withdraw agreement if the government considers that necessary. \n    \n    \n    At a practical level, full knowledge and concurrence means: \n    \n    \n    First, that Australia is to be consulted about any new purpose proposed for any activity, or a significant change to an existing purpose, and we will be advised of any significant change to expected outcomes. \n    \n    \n    Second, it means that Australia will be briefed and advised on outcomes actually achieved. \n    \n    \n    And finally, proposals for new equipment or significant upgrades to existing equipment, including communications links, will be advised in sufficient time to confirm that the changes align with mutually-agreed purposes, or to seek further clarification, if required. \n    \n    \n    There is much work undertaken to ensure that the objectives of these practical steps are met. \n    \n    \n    The Department of Defence regularly reviews the management and implementation of this policy to ensure \u2013 and be fully satisfied \u2013 that governance is effective and being appropriately and stringently adhered to. \n    \n    \n    Australians who hold senior positions at these joint facilities, as well as at Australian facilities that are used by foreign governments, are fully and deeply integrated into decision-making and implementation processes. \n    \n    \n    While the details of the policy and its implementation have evolved over time, to better reflect the changes in our national security environment and to keep pace with technological progress, the fundamental principles of full knowledge and concurrence have not changed, and we are never complacent about its application. \n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.22am GMT \n \n \n  12.03am GMT  \n  \n  Protecting and enhancing our economic wellbeing \n   \n   As outlined in the 2016 defence white paper, defending our maritime trade routes is part of Australia\u2019s primary strategic defence priorities. \n   These maritime highways are the backbone of our foreign trade coming in and out of Australia. It is crucial for Australian jobs and our economy that these routes remain open and secure, with unimpeded freedom of access. \n   Regional actions have the ability to adversely impact regional security and economic stability. \n   Facilities such as Pine Gap help reduce this risk, in support of the rules-based global order, by providing early warning of potentially hostile activities and developments that threaten to destabilise the region. \n   It is also important to recognise the real economic and social benefits these facilities have in regional Australia. \n   Apart from the jobs generated directly by these facilities, workers contribute to local economies and form part of the social fabric of these communities. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.13am GMT \n \n \n  12.03am GMT  \n  \n  More than military and intelligence value \n   \n   While much of the public debate seems to centre on the military applications of US capabilities in Australia or their contributions to intelligence matters, these capabilities also play a crucial role in our everyday lives. \n   In 2017, a new space surveillance radar reached full operational capability at the Harold E Holt facility. \n   This radar serves as a dedicated sensor node in the Global Space Surveillance Network, in support of our Combined Space Operations cooperation with the US, United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand. \n   It will be joined by a new space surveillance telescope, which is scheduled to reach full operational capability in 2022. \n   Together, this radar and telescope will identify and track objects in space, which will help satellite owners avoid collisions with space junk and other satellites. \n   With so many aspects of Australian life and business reliant on satellites, if one were to be severely damaged or knocked out of orbit, that could have disastrous impacts on Australian individuals and businesses. \n   As another example, the Learmonth solar observatory, also in Western Australia, monitors solar emissions, which helps to protect communications equipment from solar interference. \n   This space weather facility is jointly operated by the Bureau of Meteorology and the US air force. \n   Solar weather can affect transmission quality for services, such as mobile phone and internet networks as well as television and radio transmissions. \n   Solar weather can also affect power grids, causing blackouts. \n   Predicting solar weather is important because it allows organisations that own infrastructure, such as satellites, communication networks or power grids, to mitigate its impacts. \n   This is particularly relevant as more people use wireless internet devices as part of their daily lives, whether that be for entertainment, education, social media or business. \n    Our work with the US has also allowed us to share critical information. \n   As a result, the intelligence we produce together has saved lives. \n   It has saved American and Australian lives, not only on the battlefield, but it has saved civilian lives as well. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.18am GMT \n \n \n  12.03am GMT  \n  \n  The significant value of Australian facilities supporting United States capabilities \n   \n   While Pine Gap may be the highest-profile joint facility on Australian soil, it is not the only facility in Australia that is jointly operated with the US, or that hosts US defence activities and capabilities. \n   The Joint Geological and Geophysical Research Station is another joint facility that Australia operates with the US in Alice Springs. \n   This facility, run by Geoscience Australia and the US air force, was established in 1955 to monitor nuclear explosions during the cold war. \n   Today, it performs a crucial role as part of the international monitoring system of the comprehensive test-ban treaty, which prohibits \u201cany nuclear weapon test explosion\u201d anywhere in the world. \n   It is a little-known fact that this research station, in Alice Springs, detected and geolocated North Korea\u2019s sixth nuclear test, on 3 September 2017. \n   Like Pine Gap, the Naval Communication Station Harold E Holt, in Exmouth, Western Australia, has also contributed to Australia\u2019s national security for over half a century. \n   This Australian facility, which was previously jointly operated with the US navy until we assumed full control in the 1990s, provides communications for Australian and US submarines and ships. \n   This includes communications for the submarine-based nuclear deterrence capabilities of the US in the Indo-Pacific, which are crucial to credible deterrence, a stable nuclear balance and our own security. \n   Another important communications facility is the Australian Defence Satellite Communication Station in Geraldton, Western Australia, which hosts a ground station for US military satellite communications systems used by Australian and US forces on operations. \n   This facility contributes to the safety of deployed Australian and US military personnel. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.19am GMT \n \n \n  12.02am GMT  \n  \n  The Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap \u2013 over 50 years of success \n   \n   The Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap has made \u2013 and continues to make \u2013 a critical contribution to the security of both Australia and the US. \n   It represents one of the finest examples of collaboration, innovation and integration, and has delivered remarkable intelligence dividends to both our nations. \n   As its name clearly states, Pine Gap is a \u201cjoint\u201d defence facility, run by the governments of both Australia and the US \u2013 as close and enduring partners.  \n   Pine Gap\u2019s workforce is split approximately 50:50, between Australians and Americans, with Australians holding key decision-making positions at the facility and having direct involvement in operations and tasking. \n   Since its establishment in 1967, Pine Gap has evolved from its original cold war mission, focused on early warning for Soviet ballistic missiles, to meet new demands and new challenges. \n   It has acquired cutting-edge, innovative technologies to do so. \n   Pine Gap has become a central element of our intelligence cooperation with the US and it continues to have relevance in delivering intelligence on a range of contemporary security priorities, such as terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and monitoring foreign weapons development. \n   Pine Gap also supports compliance monitoring with international arms control and disarmament agreements. \n   By hosting this capability, Australia supports the verification of adherence to arms control agreements, in keeping with the government\u2019s comprehensive policy approach to arms control and counter-proliferation. \n   It has provided monitoring and early warning capabilities of ballistic missile launches since 1999, following the closure of Joint Defence Facility Nurrungar. \n   Reliable, early and accurate warning of ballistic missile launches provides a crucial contribution to global stability, with Pine Gap helping to provide reassurance against the possibility of a surprise missile attack. \n   Much has been theorised about Pine Gap\u2019s role, for instance its contribution to US operations against terrorism. \n   While the Australian government, as a matter of longstanding practice, does not comment on intelligence matters, Australians can be assured that the government has full oversight of activities undertaken at Pine Gap and that these activities are undertaken in accordance with Australian and international law. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.21am GMT \n \n \n  12.02am GMT  \n  \n  The Australia-United States Alliance \u2013 underpinning Australian security \n   \n   The United States is our most important ally. Our military forces work side-by-side around the world, to meet global security challenges and to promote peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. \n   No other global power has values and interests more closely aligned with Australia\u2019s than the United States. \n   The presence of US military forces across the Indo-Pacific plays a vital role in ensuring regional security, and the strategic and economic weight of the US is essential to the continued effective functioning of the rules-based global order. \n   Australia\u2019s alliance with the US is enshrined in the Anzus treaty, signed on 1 September 1951. \n   With the support of successive Australian and US governments, the alliance has grown in depth and complexity over time, and continues to deliver real benefits to both our countries. \n   The alliance gives us unparalleled access to the most advanced technology, equipment and intelligence, which is central to maintaining the potency of the Australian defence force. \n   Australia sources much of our most critical combat capability from the US. \n   Australia would be unable to develop the range of high-end capabilities we need without the alliance. \n   Crucially, the alliance also means that Australia benefits from the extended nuclear deterrence provided by the US. \n   During the cold war, the US contributed to the security of its allies through its ability to respond with nuclear weapons if allies were attacked by the Soviet Union. \n   Today, global geopolitics have changed, but the core principles of extended nuclear deterrence have not. \n   Potential adversaries understand that an attack on Australia is an attack on the alliance. \n   This brings me to an important point. \n   Australia is not only a beneficiary of the US policy of extended nuclear deterrence, it is an active supporter of it, through our joint efforts with the US at Pine Gap and at other facilities, such as the Naval Communications Station Harold E Holt, and the Joint Geological and Geophysical Research Station. \n   As the then-prime minister, Bob Hawke, noted in his public statement on Pine Gap in 1984, Australia should not claim the protection of nuclear deterrence without being willing to make a contribution to its effectiveness. \n   Hosting these joint facilities and US strategic capabilities on our soil is Australia\u2019s important contribution to the alliance. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.05am GMT \n \n \n  12.01am GMT  \n Christopher Pyne gives update on work performed at joint US-Australia facilities \n  \n  Bear with me: Christopher Pyne has given an update on the joint operations Australia runs with the US, like Pine Gap. It is rare we are given public updates, so I am going to include the whole statement over the next few posts. \n   \n   The joint facilities we operate with the United States, such as the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap, as well as the Australian facilities that host US strategic capabilities, are some of the most tangible manifestations of the strength and depth of the Australia-United States alliance. \n   However, due to the classified nature of some of the most sensitive work performed at these facilities, it is necessary that relatively few people are briefed on those roles and functions. \n   It is therefore in the public interest that governments make periodic public statements on these facilities. \n   Today, I want to update the parliament and the Australian public on the deliberate policy principles that govern these facilities and the contributions they make, not only to regional and global security, but to our own security and national prosperity.  \n   The public can have confidence that its government is acting lawfully and responsibly in overseeing such activities, and that Australia\u2019s continuing support for these activities is in our nation\u2019s best interests. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.24am GMT \n \n \n  11.52pm GMT  \n  \n  In the House of Representatives the attorney general Christian Porter has introduced a few new bills, including one that makes changes to the foreign influence transparency scheme, which has only been up and running for two months.  \n  The most important change is the definition of \u201ccommunications activity\u201d would be changed to capture \u201cinformation or material being distributed to the public\u201d.  \n  That would mean that agents of foreign principals would have to register for distribution pamphlets, for example, in the election. \n  It makes a few tune-ups for what the explanatory memorandum calls \u201cgaps\u201d in the reporting requirements.  \n   Apparently some reporting requirements were applied only to people who registered under the scheme, and that has to be extended to those who are \u201cliable to register\u201d.  \n  Oops. \n  \n Updated at 11.54pm GMT \n \n \n  11.51pm GMT  \n  \n  Doug Cameron, who will retire at the next election, had a few things to say about his estimates sparring partner, Michaelia Cash, this morning: \n   \n   Michaelia Cash is a disgraced minister, she has been demoted and my view is she should resign, \n   This is a terrible cover-up that\u2019s going on in Senate estimates. When you have the Australian federal police saying that Michaelia Cash has not put statements in then that\u2019s good enough for me. \n   This is the Australian federal police against a disgraced minister. \n   Also Michael Keenan is in the same boat. He has not put a statement in and it\u2019s absolutely not acceptable to go to the Senate and argue that you have given a statement when the federal police said that is not the case. \n   On two occasions they have refused to put statements in. This is a minister who just doesn\u2019t get it. \n   She should resign, she should be open, she will probably have another option today if she appears at Senate estimates today to correct the record. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.56pm GMT \n \n \n  11.35pm GMT  \n  \n  The dairy wars have now descended into the major political parties pointing the finger at the other for defending [insert whatever] supermarket here. \n  It\u2019s enough to make you lactose intolerant.  \n  \n \n \n  11.33pm GMT  \n  \n  The Department of Jobs and Small Business is appearing at Senate estimates and Labor\u2019s Doug Cameron spent the start of the hearing taking issue with what he calls another Michaelia Cash \u201cno show\u201d. \n  Cash is the minister for small business, but is being represented by Liberal senator Linda Reynolds.  \n  Cameron says he\u2019d prefer to ask Cash questions about her portfolio, rather than a \u201cjunior minister\u201d.  \n  \u201cYou can insult me all you like,\u201d Reynolds tells him. \n  \u201cShe should stop hiding and she should come here and front up,\u201d an angry Cameron says, prompting the committee to suspend briefly. A sign of things to come, I\u2019d suspect, as Cash will be appearing in this committee later today, according to Reynolds. \n  Eventually, Cameron lets up and the committee moves to policy questions. The department\u2019s Nathan Smyth tells Labor senator Deb O\u2019Neill that 3,933 businesses have signed up to host PaTH interns since April 2017.  \n  The program, a Turnbull government initiative, was slammed by unions who said people were being paid $4 an hour.  \n  The government had promised 30,000 placements a year \u2013 with 18,000-20,000 businesses required to meet this aim. \u201cIs this a policy failure, it looks like one?\u201d O\u2019Neill says.Smyth tells the hearing that 30,000 figure was more of a \u201ccap\u201d than a target. \n  We previously covered the poor take up rate in more detail here. \n  \n Updated at 11.35pm GMT \n \n \n  11.32pm GMT  \n  \n  Josh Frydenberg and Zed Seselja met with retirees upset about Labor\u2019s proposed changes to franking credits. \n  Expect to hear more of their stories in question time today.  \n  \n Updated at 11.34pm GMT \n \n \n  11.25pm GMT  \n  \n   \n   \n    Walk and talk.

The bill strengthens Australia\u2019s counter-terrorism framework by ensuring that the government has the means to protect the community from the risk of terrorist acts.  \n  2. Schedule 1 of the bill contains measures to introduce new restrictions on the existing arrangements for bail and parole. This implements the agreement of the Council of Australian Governments at its meeting on 9 June 2017. Offenders who have links with, or have shown support for, terrorist activities will not be released on bail or parole unless they can show that there are exceptional circumstances that would justify their release into the community. \n  3. Schedule 2 of the bill makes amendments to improve the operation of the continuing detention order (CDO) scheme. These amendments address deficiencies in the existing CDO scheme to ensure that the commonwealth is able to seek the continued detention of terrorist offenders serving custodial sentences who are assessed by a judge in civil proceedings to present an unacceptable risk to the community at the time their sentences finish. \n  \n Updated at 11.25pm GMT \n \n \n  11.12pm GMT  \n  \n  Ugh. Now that I have wrestled with tech demons, I can tell you that as expected, the motion to suspend standing orders goes down, 69 to 74. \n  \n \n \n  10.58pm GMT  \n  \n  The division is called \u2013 to see if Labor can suspend standing orders. \n  It does not look like the Nationals will be backing it.  \n  \n \n \n  10.55pm GMT  \n  \n  David Gillespie is not a fan of Labor\u2019s plan for the dairy industry. Because he says most of it is already happening. \n  Joel Fitzgibbon told the ABC this, this morning: \n   \n   There is no good just sitting back as a government expecting the market to work out these things for itself. It is clear that is not going to happen. We have waited too long for that. It is clear we are waiting with false hope. So we need to intervene, but we are not just talking about a minimum price: we are going to put into place a mandatory code of conduct to govern behaviour in the industry; we are going to drive energy prices down with some energy policy that returns investment certainty to the energy sector; and we are going to introduce a farm productivity and sustainability plan which helps again make a contribution towards getting the latest innovation out onto the farm to help farmers lift their productivity.  \n   \n  And of course they are calling on the government to get the ACCC involved. \n  Gillespie says: \n   \n   \u201cThey say they will refer milk pricing to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. They say they will support a mandatory code of conduct. This has all been done and the ACCC\u2019s key recommendation was a mandatory code of conduct, which farmers have asked for and we are delivering on,\u201d he said in a statement. \n    \u201cAs the member for Lyne, I have continued to advocate directly with the ACCC and ministers about market failure not just in the dairy industry, but also other industries my constituents operate in, who have also suffered under competition law. \n    \u201cThe Nationals have been prosecuting the case for changes to competition law for years and Labor has failed to support us.\u201d \n    \u201cThey obviously now know that dairy farmers are doing it tough because they heard it on the news, and so they issue a press release. \n    \u201cI have spent a lot of time with many of my dairy farmers who have given me a very accurate picture of the contractual arrangements they have had to endure. Some of the processors who they sell their milk to have clearly not been interested in their long term viability, nor have the major supermarkets who have also not understood the significant damage they have inflicted on the industry with their pathetic $1-a-litre milk campaigns. \n    \u201cThe mandatory code of conduct which everyone has had an opportunity to help develop will provide a solid framework for the supply chain however it is going to take some time to work through the system when it comes into effect in the near future.\u201d \n    \u201cThat is why I have been calling on the supermarkets and the processors to come to the party with measures that provide immediate relief for dairy farmers while a mandatory code of conduct is implemented and a fair dinkum milk price index can be established.\u201d \n    \u201cHaving seen the positive response from Woolworths and the pathetic responses from Coles and Aldi, clearly there are some in this space who have no moral compass. \n   \u201c ...I was hoping with a little pressure, the major supermarkets and the processors would all recognise the tough situation the dairy industry is in, particularly the producers, and taken steps to rectify some of the unsustainable farm gate prices they have offered.\u201d \n    \u201cI have never been one to advocate for government running the market, but where there is market failure, it is my view that we must intervene to make sure the market works for everyone. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.00pm GMT \n \n \n  10.49pm GMT  \n  \n  Lyndal Curtis is back today, as Mike Bowers\u2019 \u201cwork experience kid\u201d. \n  (Lyndal has about 25 years\u2019 experience in covering politics, which is why her and Bowers laugh every time one of them refers to her \u201cwork experience\u201d.

We\u2019ll see the impact of that in terms of how it affects the bill, but what is very important is that there\u2019s inadequate medical facilities on Nauru and PNG for the significant medical assessment and treatment that is required and that is why we have had transfers to Australia which, you know, for many of these people. That\u2019s what this legislation focuses on in terms of advice by doctors to the minister regarding individuals that should come to Australia for assessment and treatment. \n   \n  And what does he think about the Christmas Island decision (the government wants to send medical transfers to the Australian territory, rather than the mainland): \n   \n    I think it\u2019s very important to focus on what the facilities are on Christmas Island. Do they provide for the appropriate assessment and medical treatment of asylum seekers that are in need, assessed to be in need that are from our care on Nauru and PNG? It seems that the current facilities on Christmas Island are inadequate and bringing them up to be appropriate would come at great cost. If the government wishes to do so, then of course that is their prerogative, but, you know, it\u2019s something that I would, want to follow carefully. \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.14pm GMT \n \n \n  9.37pm GMT  \n  \n  Meanwhile, Labor is not letting up on the Paladin contract, either. \n  Shayne Neumann has sent the auditor general this letter this morning: \n   \n   Dear Auditor-General, \n   \n   \n   I am writing to request an urgent audit into the circumstances surrounding the Department of Home Affairs\u2019 procurement of garrison support and welfare services in Papua New Guinea. \n   \n   \n   In the course of the past week, the Australian Financial Review has highlighted significant concerns related to the companies contracted to provide these services \u2013 particularly letters of intent with Paladin Solutions Group and a subsequent contract with Paladin Holding Pte Ltd. \n   \n   \n   The letters of intent and contract has resulted in the expenditure of $423 million of taxpayers\u2019 money. \n    The original letters of intent with Paladin Solutions Group were undertaken under section 2.6 of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules \u2013 with the Department of Home Affairs using these provisions to approach Paladin Solutions Group directly \u2013 and Paladin Solutions Group only. \n   At Senate Estimates yesterday, Department of Home Affairs officials claimed that they were \u201cdealing with an urgent situation\u201d when they signed an initial letter of intent with Paladin Solutions Group in September 2017 \u2013 with letters totalling $89 million. \n   The Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs told the Senate Estimates committee, \u201cmy very strong preference would have been to have a long lead time, an open tender, a global search, assisted by specialised consultants and advisers.\u201d \n   Despite this preference, a subsequent contract worth $333 million awarded to Paladin Holding Pte Ltd was signed on 28 February 2018 with no other providers considered \u2013 despite reports today indicating that other companies, such as Toll Holdings, were considering bidding. \n   The ANAO\u2019s report 32 of 2016-2017 titled Offshore Processing Centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea: Contract Management of Garrison Support and Welfare Services concluded that the Department had \u201cfallen well short of effective contract management practice.\u201d \n    This report was a damning indictment of the Department\u2019s management of these contracts and stated: \n   - contracts \u201cwere established in circumstances of great haste to give effect to government policy decisions\u201d; \n   - \u201cthe Department did not put in place effective mechanisms to manage the contracts\u201d; and \n   - \u201ccontract variations totalling over $1 billion were made without a documented assessment of value for money.\u201d \n    Labor is acutely aware of the current Government\u2019s abysmal management of Australian-funded regional processing centres and their failure to negotiate other third country resettlement options, leaving vulnerable people languishing in indefinite detention. \n    Given the level of expenditure associated with these contracts, the Government\u2019s poor track-record, and the concerning reports and allegations related to the entities involved, I seek your urgent investigation of the circumstances surrounding these contract arrangements. \n    I would be happy to discuss this issue at your earliest convenience. \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.13pm GMT \n \n \n  9.28pm GMT  \n Good morning \n  \n  Happy hump day! \n  Michaelia Cash turned up to Senate estimates late yesterday and insisted she had cooperated with the AFP investigation into who leaked the Australian Workers\u2019 Union raids to the media. \n  But that came after federal police told the same Senates committee that Cash and Michael Keenan had not provided witness statements. The deputy AFP commissioner Leanne Close told the committee that both Keenan and Cash had been asked for witness statements but had declined, as was their legal right to do so. \n  Cash provided a transcript of her answers to a previous Senate estimates hearing on the same issue. \n   \n   \n    Cash says she provided a voluntary statement to the AFP. She says she sent them Hansard. The AFP said yesterday they got a letter from Cash, and the letter wasn\u2019t a witness statement #estimates\u2014 Katharine Murphy (@murpharoo) February 19, 2019\n    \n   \n  Things got testy. The Labor senator Murray Watt offered to escort Cash to a police station so she could make a statement.  \n   \n   \n    Murray Watt is THIS CLOSE to offering to walk Michaelia Cash down to the cop shop now to give a witness statement. She says Estimates Oct 2017 was her \"very best\" recollection. #auspol #estimates\u2014 Paul Karp (@Paul_Karp) February 19, 2019\n    \n   \n  Cash also revealed she had not read the estimates transcript of when the AFP had been asked about her case from the previous day. \n  Her reason? \n  \u201cBecause I haven\u2019t.\u201d \n   \n   \n    The eternal why, right there. https://t.co/YsJL1ZYpyk\u2014 Katharine Murphy (@murpharoo) February 19, 2019\n    \n   \n  Cash told the Labor members of the committee she believed their attacks had been unfair: \n  \u201cI am waiting now for an apology.\u201d \n   \n   \n    Hell will freeze over before I apologise to @SenatorCash but she should take @SenatorWong\u2019s advice and say sorry to the Australian public. And then resign #Estimates\u2014 Senator Doug Cameron (@SenatorDoug) February 19, 2019\n    \n   \n  Cash is back today. So that should be fun. \n  Meanwhile, Nick McKenzie and Richard Baker from the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age have a new installment in the Helloworld saga, which caught up Mathias Cormann yesterday: \n   \n   Australia\u2019s US ambassador, Joe Hockey, asked embassy staff to meet with a corporate travel company before it lobbied for government work, even though the former treasurer is close friends with the company\u2019s chief executive and now a big shareholder. \n   In April 2017, Mr Hockey told Washington embassy staff to meet with an executive from Helloworld, the listed travel services company managed by Andrew Burnes, Mr Hockey\u2019s good friend and federal Liberal Party treasurer.\u201d \n   \n  So what I am saying is today is not going to be boring. \n  Mike Bowers is on deck already, as is Katharine Murphy and Paul Karp. You\u2019ll have everyone else in the Guardian\u2019s brains trust dropping in across the day as well. \n  Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.  \n  \n Updated at 10.11pm GMT \n"}
